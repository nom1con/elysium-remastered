# Crossbowmen are inferior to archers, due to the exploding dice system. Someone did the math, and surprisingly this is true even vs higher armor. Now buffed crossbow damage to d6 (ie exactly double of a bow), which makes crossbowmen slightly worse vs unarmored targets, but better than archers vs armored targets. To avoid inadvertently buffing a bunch of other monsters (hobmarks xbows, pirates etc) some of them get a light crossbow (original d5) instead.

Even a less gifted Bard has their uses, providing lively entertainment at banquets, festive gatherings, and any occasion where a noble's guests require distraction-or, failing that, a good laugh at the Bard's expense."

descr "It is easy to assume the King is the sole ruler of the kingdom. But as any married man knows, even maintaining authority in the household can be a challenge. The royal marriage is no exception. Though the King holds the formal title, the Queen may well be the true power behind the throne. Our Queen is said to be an enchantress of great power, and commands immense respect among the commoners. Since her arrival, the forests have grown wilder, and sightings of unicorns have become strangely frequent."

descr "The King's Guard is an elite force made up of the strongest and most battle-hardened soldiers in the realm. Its members are often handpicked from families that proudly trace their lineage back to the first men, giving them an air of ancient prestige, and a reputation for being particularly resistant to dark magic. While their official duty is to safeguard the Royal family, in practice, they are frequently dispatched with the main army in 'preemptive' defensive operations."

descr "Bedtime stories are full of tales about the so-called Fay Folk, imaginary beings said to appear in untouched forests where no road has ever been laid. According to these tales, they imitate human dreams and legends, forming mock courts with queens, vassals, soldiers, and servants, generally behaving with a logic that defies adult comprehension. One story tells of a Fay Knight who challenged every red-haired opponent he saw, citing 'ancestral symmetry.' Another speaks of a Fay wanderer who refused to cross a river until someone read him a poem about boats. When no poem was available, he waited three days, then crossed anyway, declaring the silence 'a kind of stanza.' The scholar Merovian insists these creatures are real and drawn to unresolved narratives. He provides no evidence for this theory, though if correct, it would presumably make his own endlessly speculative writings irresistible to them."

descr "'Ah, the Blue Rose,' they say. 'The heart of the realm. Plucked by gods and waiting to be replanted.' Then they stare wistfully into the distance. No one really knows what it means. Still, it remains the talk of the court, and to send no one in search of it would be to admit the throne has no poetry. A select brotherhood of knights now rides in its name. They are granted unicorns, wear ceremonial armor polished beyond practicality, and speak little, unless reciting vows. Though tasked with finding the fabled flower, they mostly seem content to roam the countryside, fight brigands, and question local peasants for 'clues'."

descr "The Longdead are so called because their bones have lain long enough in the ground that worms and other corpse-feeders have gnawed away most of the flesh.  While most longdead are the result of necromantic practices, there are numerous reports of skeletal remains walking about without necromantic leadership.  While tempting, most of us have discarded the idea that the bones of mortals carry memories, and independent longdead arise when the memories of the bones have been weakened enough to forget that they are dead, but remember how to walk.  This Dementia Theory is at least more attractive than the Bored Bones Theory that claims that everything is inhabited by a spirit, a spirit that can become bored with lying around immobile and therefore animates the vessel it inhabits, in this case a set of unfleshed bones."

descr "If one is desperate enough to seek a pathway to Hades, the crooked branches of the Gulthias Tree is said to point the way. Formed when an ancient tree is corrupted by necromantic magic, it drains life from the land, turning forests into Shadow Woods. It raises nearby corpses as mindless thralls to guard it and spread its influence. Though rooted in place, it's notoriously hard to destroy without fire or divine magic."

descr "The Tartarian Spirit is the ghost of a dead titan, bound to Tartarus by the ashen earth of Hades and unbreakable chains. Fortunately, inventive necromancers have found the means to perform vicarious exhumations, freeing the trapped soul from the binding earth and summoning it to Elysium where it will reinhabit its now petrified corpse. Having spent eternities buried in Tartarian soil the titan has become a powerful wielder of both stygian and geomantic magic. The spirit still wields the chains used to bind it in Tartarus, as a reminder that it remains a slave."

descr "The Dracolich is an undead dragon. While they can originate from any dragon color, their decayed state leaves them a uniform, indistinguishable grey or brown. Their breath weapon no longer functions, as their internal organs have withered away and their ribcage is no longer airtight. Due to the near-indestructibility of dragon bones, Dracoliches can be truly ancient. They retain the greed and selfishness characteristic of living dragons, now twisted by a sinister hatred for all living things, but goats and knights in particular."

descr "The Tormented Hosts are believed to be the lingering remnants of sacrificial victims from the era of Baal. Their suffering did not fade but accumulated over centuries, saturating the stones of the god's abandoned ziggurats. Though they have no form of their own, necromancers can coax them into manifestation, shaping them into drifting, spectral entities. The Hosts do not think or speak. When summoned, they reach toward the living as if pleading for release, but their touch drains vitality, and their howls unnerve even the most disciplined minds."

descr "It is often deemed wise to root out Witches from the villages while they are still young.  Because should they master the art of Witchcraft, they will become very powerful and might just turn the entire population into pigs.  When they are still young, they are not powerful at all and there are several good methods to find out who is a Witch.  One popular way is to antagonize the girl suspect and if you later become sick you can be pretty sure she is a Witch, because a Witch is always vengeful."

descr "The Marsh Giants descend from a tribe of Hill Giants that in the ancient past committed an unforgivable sin against their kin. Fleeing retribution, they sought refuge in remote swamps. Over the centuries, their bodies adapted to life in the filthy mire, and only their language served as a remnant of their former lives. Marsh Giants are cannibals and worship forgotten evils of the deep bogs. While they are susceptible to the influence of witches, most other creatures give them a wide berth, leaving these them to their fetid homes and dark rituals."

descr "In ages past, powerful witches made dark bargains with the Old Ones to escape death. At life's end, they surrendered their flesh, transferring mind and power into the swarm of worms and insects that devoured their remains. This is how the Worm Souls came to be, sustained by the lifeforce granted through their pact. Though they take on a vaguely humanoid form, their bodies are living swarms. They endure indefinitely, as each creature within them is replaceable, so long as the bargain holds. Yet their existence is far from human, more a force of the land than a person in any meaningful sense."

descr "Humans are not the only race that have problems with their bones starting to wander after having been dead for a long time.  The beasts have the same problem, but to a somewhat lesser extent.  It is believed that boars enjoy eating skeletal remains and thus leaves little left to become bored and walk again.  Many necromancers find it useful to reanimate beasts as they are usually stronger than humans and when dead they are equally stupid.  Reanimating the bones requires taxing incantations and much manual work and is probably best left to the eager apprentice."

#-------------- Witch class & recruitment -------------------# 

selectclass 4
classdescr classdescr "In every village, there is a wise woman, claiming knowledge of healing arts or the ability to read fortunes from the palm of a hand. Most are harmless charlatans, offering little more than superstition. Yet, a rare few possess true power-these are the Witches, feared by both men and trolls alike. Witches follow the ancient ways, communicating with the Old Ones, slumbering entities who roamed Elysium long before humanity's arrival. Shunned by civilization, they draw their power from the wilds, from the shadows and darkness. Wielding control over swarms of venomous creatures, twisted plants, and spirits of the forest, the Witch commands nature itself. Their brews, concoctions of fungi gathered from the marshes and forests, serve as offerings to lure the Old Ones and creatures of the dark. The larger the offering, the stronger the bond. Yet, summoning an Old One is no simple task-it requires careful preparation, a wealth of fungi, and an understanding of the great risk involved. Failure, of course, can awaken an ancient and vengeful force."
classabdescr "Witches collect fungi from forests and marshes. Witches can use fungi to perform magic rituals. Poison Archers and Lizard Cavalry can be recruited by also spending fungi."

descr "Oni are ugly, wild demons with pot-bellies and unkempt hair.  They come in different colors and with different abnormalities, but red or green skin with a pair of horns or an extra eye or ear seem to be the most common variants.  Although all Oni enjoy striking people with large clubs, most of them are also capable of dealing pain using their demonic magic.  The Oni have a great appetite and consume all the food and drink they can get hold of.  However, food is also their weakness as they cannot pass a line of carefully arranged potatoes.  Putting a few potatoes on the doorstep is an effective way to keep the Oni out, but on the other hand beasts and especially Bears might be attracted by the potatoes instead."

descr "The Wanyudo is a yokai that takes the form of a burning ox cart wheel, bearing the tormented face of a man. Folklore often describes it as the condemned soul of a tyrannical lord who, in life, was infamous for having his victims dragged behind ox carts. However, given the apparent number of these malevolent spirits, this specific origin is unlikely. Other accounts of the Wanyudo seem more plausible. In one tale, as a Wanyudo rolled through a town, a woman peered out her window to catch a glimpse. The Wanyudo spotted her and said, 'Instead of looking at me, look at your own child!' Startled, the woman turned to find her baby lying on the floor in a pool of blood, his legs missing. When she looked back at the demon, she saw her child's legs in its mouth as it ate them."

descr "Oni are ugly, wild demons with pot-bellies and unkempt hair.  They come in different colors and with different abnormalities, but red or green skin with a pair of horns or an extra eye or ear seem to be the most common variants.  Although all Oni enjoy striking people with large clubs, most of them are also capable of dealing pain using their demonic magic.  The Oni have a great appetite and consume all the food and drink they can get hold of.  However, food is also their weakness as they cannot pass a line of carefully arranged potatoes.  Putting a few potatoes on the doorstep is an effective way to keep the Oni out, but on the other hand beasts and especially Bears might be attracted by the potatoes instead."

Revered as storytellers, they hold authority both in the feast hall and on the battlefield. They mark their chosen with sacred tattoos, each drawn from the old stories and said to shield the body, sharpen the mind, or call the favor of the dead. At gatherings, the Wotan recount tales of conquest, betrayal, and vengeance - the hall falling silent at their voice, then erupting in laughter, song, or rage as the tribe joins in. In battle, they move where the fighting is thickest, chanting, rattling, and howling like those possessed. Those around them soon take up the rhythm, laughing and singing as they charge, as if the battle itself were only another tale waiting to be told."

descr "A warlord is a chieftain who has risen through conquest. He commands not only his own clan, but others drawn to his banner by force or reward. Many first gain power through the seizure of imperial lands. When the spoils are shared, rival clans may choose to follow, though such loyalty rarely lasts. Tribute is promised more often than it is paid, and each alliance must be held through gifts, threats, or the memory of what happened to the last chief who refused."

descr "A barbarian king is a rare figure, said to rise only when the spirits permit it. Unlike warlords, who rule by conquest, kings are believed to carry the blessing of the ancestors. Their bodies are marked with tattoos of victory, and their weapons bear charms of sharpness and binding. Before a man may be called king, the Enaries must speak his name without being told it. If they name another, the claim is forfeit. A king holds no fixed throne, but may judge disputes between tribes, call councils, and demand oaths sworn for more than a single battle. Some reign for a generation; others vanish within a season. Among the tribes, this is not seen as failure, only that the time of kings has passed, for now."

Instead, they rely on great battering rams to breach the gates: felled timber bound in hide, mounted on wheels where the ground allows, and screened against arrows with rough panels of wood and leather. The head is often adorned with horns, a mark of strength and defiance, said to carry the spirit of the beast into battle. Service with the ram is given to the boldest, and few survive-but those who fall are named in the feast that follows. Those who return are marked with red paint and not expected to fight again."

classdescr "Since ancient times, Barbarian hordes have plundered the lands of Elysium.  Of unknown origin, their sudden arrival at the fringes of civilization sends tremors throughout the realms.  Some speculate that they hail from small villages in secluded regions while others say they come from the Netherworld.  The Barbarian threat is always present and only with a united show of force can the tide be turned. ^Barbarians are physically more powerful than normal men, but they are also more vulnerable to magic.  The Barbarian Warlord cannot buy advanced weapons like siege engines, but may sometimes recruit werebears or fierce warriors from independent warbands.  Werebears look just like ordinary Barbarians until they reveal themselves in combat, where their strength and rage make them far more powerful than a common Barbarian warrior.  Barbarians also have access to Spirit Guides who use magical herbs to contact ancestral spirits and summon them to join the armies of Barbarians again.  More powerful Spirit Guides are called Enaries."
classabdescr "Barbarian troops are cheap and strong.^Barbarian camps are defended by a wooden idol inhabited by spirits.^Spirit Guides and Enaries collect magical herbs.^Spirit Guides and Enaries can perform rituals to summon ancestor spirits and create effigies.^Warpriests and Wotan can enchant warriors with magical tattoos."

descr "In ancient times the Emperor would have put up statues of himself in any major settlement.  This has often been described as an act of vanity by many historians.  However, a few opposing theories have been put forth.  By sharing his image in both statues and coins, the Emperor would be present in the mind of every citizen.  When such an awareness reaches a certain level, it would give the Emperor a sort of divine focus or divine aegis if he so desires.  This can then be redirected and focused through the statues and there has been speculation that it would keep the citizens calm, giving them a sense of being watched at all times - which would explain the elaborate eyes in many statues. Another more sinister theory states the statues erected by Vasilis the Putrid somehow siphoned power from the living population to sustain his undead legions."

descr "The first Renatus was the eldest member of the Renatae, a keeper of records, and the last in a bloodline bred for magical aptitude. Though his magic was unremarkable compared to other mages of the realm, he somehow stumbled upon the secret to immortality. He passed this knowledge to a select group of apprentices, though, curiously, only male members of the order succeeded in following his method. The path to immortality, as devised by the first Renatus, involves a peculiar mix: alchemical residues, a strong magical affinity, a strict frugal diet, and absolute celibacy. Unsurprisingly, the latter two have dissuaded most alchemists from attempting this route, grumbling that there must be an easier-or at least more enjoyable-way. Hieronyma the Clouded, a prominent skeptic, insists that a Renatus isn't truly immortal. Instead, she claims the order has perfected a method of creating body and mind duplicates of each Renatus, stored in ancient basins beneath their main palace. According to her, when one "Renatus" dies, another copy simply takes his place. Although the male Renati are regarded as the order's public leaders, rumors persist of a secret cabal of old Renatae pulling strings from the shadows with the lofty aim of creating the perfect human. While there's no evidence to support such claims, many heroes boast of their success in seducing a local Renata."

descr "In old times any construction of bridges and temples as well as any declaration of war demanded a sacrifice of a hecatomb to the Elysian pantheon.  An Elysian hecatomb is one hundred sheep, some of which may be goats instead as long as they can be kept under control.  The sacrifices were performed by the Flamen, who wielded considerable power at the time.  In order to balance that power, the Flamen was limited in several ways and still is.  He may not touch iron, meat, beans or living horses.  He is always required to wear the Flamen headdress, even when sleeping, and he may not look at a drawn weapon.  Some of the more creative Emperors of old added to the lists of what a Flamen could and should do.  After the gods had demanded a particularly vast number of hecatombs from Emperor Reus IV, the Emperor ruled that when the Flamen spoke on non-religious matters, he had to bow to the senior member of the Senate between each syllable.^With new cults appearing, these sacrifices became less and less important, and today the Flamen's sacrifices mainly concern less important things, such as weddings, the inauguration of a new porch and similar events. Nonetheless, the Flamen maintain the old ways and commune regularly with eudaimons of the land."

descr "Issued under proper authority by senatorial charter, the caravan's current members, selected for their optimism and their willingness to sign comprehensive indemnity waivers, embark with the full confidence of the Senate and a modest travel stipend, payable in advance. The Imperial Trade Caravan is tasked with the circulation of goods, the collection of minor duties, and the promotion of economic virtue across the provinces. Lightly guarded to avoid confusion with military activity, the caravan is nevertheless equipped to repel casual banditry and, under ideal conditions, discourage attention from small to medium-sized wildlife. Reports from the countryside confirm that the sight of a well-supplied caravan has a stabilizing effect on local markets and encourages compliance with provincial taxation. A petition is currently underway to name a future caravan after our archivist, who has recently completed a full inventory of the College's ink reserves."

descr "War Elephants were first encountered during the third Atavic Campaign, where the Maharaja fielded them to devastating effect against the closed ranks of the Imperial Legions. The beasts were eventually incorporated into the Imperial armies of the southern provinces, and are now employed as a counter to the armored knights of Elysium's feudal lords."

descr "When elephants were first introduced to the Imperial armies, the Cult of the Conquering Sun quickly recognized their potential. They procured several of these majestic creatures and mounted their more daring heliodromi on top, creating a platform for truly spectacular sermons and securing a notable publicity advantage over rival cults. While initially a triumph of showmanship, the war elephants proved surprisingly effective in combat, though their tendency to panic under the bright flashes of spells added a degree of unpredictability to the battlefield."

descr "Thaumaturgs are self-proclaimed miracle workers who practice magic for coin. Their skills are typically passed down through master-apprentice relationships, though many are largely self-taught. They are loosely connected but operate independently, with little allegiance to the great Cults. While their magical abilities are often exaggerated, they do possess some control over the elements, such as influencing the weather or igniting fires on command. Successful Thaumaturgs often find favor among the senatorial elite, while others earn their living by summoning rain or selling lucky charms to peasants."

descr "The Faery Dragon, a primal creature from the ancient world, is smaller and less intelligent than the dragons of Elysium but possesses a deep connection to the magic of the wild. Unlike its fiery relatives, its breath is sedative, lulling prey into a deep slumber. Once its victim is incapacitated, the Faery Dragon delivers a venomous sting from its tail, a behavior reminiscent of predatory wasps. ^Adding to this intriguing resemblance, its wings are adorned with vivid, butterfly-like patterns. This has led some scholars to propose that the Faery Dragon may not be a true dragon at all, but an evolutionary predecessor to the dragonfly. However, this theory falters upon closer inspection, as Faery Dragons conspicuously lack the habit of buzzing about water in large, decorative swarms."

descr "The Smilodon is an apex predator of the primal wilds, but fortunately appear to be extinct elsewhere. Its most striking feature, the pair of long, curved fangs, are capable of piercing even the toughest armor. They are quite fearless, and have been known to even stalk trolls and dragons. The only upside to its reintroduction to Elysium is that they may help keeping the deers in check."

# The idea of an endgame choice between a progressive and traditionalist direction is taken from Large_overhaul by Alexthebeetrayer, and to some degree Burgmeister Enhanced by Juz. The mastery rituals are adapted from the Large_Overhaul. The balloon and elephant boar monsters are copied (including great sprites) from Juz. While I did put my of spin on it, creative credits for this class rework largely belongs elsewhere.

descr "Tending the Burgmeister's gardens is the Garden Master, a Horticulturist who has dedicated his or her life to the study of the intricacies of plantlife in further detail.  While maintaining a beautiful garden, the Garden Master will also introduce strange and exotic plants to study the ways they can be used.  It is well known that they still maintain the ancient rituals of awakening trees and bushes to the defense of the Hoburg villages, should an overwhelming danger arise.  This bond with the land stems from an ancient time when the Hoburghers were more in tune with the nature around them.  At times the Garden Masters will travel the known world's colleges and universities in pursuit of more knowledge.  From various forgotten or recently discovered notebooks it has been possible to discern a peculiar interest in fertilization.  Though our scholars have had no opportunity to sample the soil there, Bibula has put forth the theory that the Hoburg heartlands are all worn out due to the high yields that have been demanded from the soil there, and the foul remains pouring out from the new manufacturies."

descr "Homarids are crustacean creatures from the elemental plane of water. They seem to have only two contradictory motivations in life - to be left alone and to eat things. However, if one of these wants is denied  it will usually get the other; if there is no-one to eat then it is undisturbed, if it is disturbed then there is most likely something it can eat. Hence the saying to be 'happy as a homarid'."

descr "Raptors are pack-hunting reptiles the size of horses, possessing a feral cunning that seems unnatural for lizards. Once they select a target, they pursue it with relentless patience. Belmonte famously recounted how his expedition took refuge in the trees for days, stalked by a pack of these predators. When they finally climbed down, believing the danger had passed, they found the raptors waiting just beyond sight. Their survival came only by the grace of El, as High Templar Guisarme-now known as the One-Legged- intervened and heroically scattered the beasts."

descr "Accounts from explorers among the deep Aztlan jungle tribes describe monumental stone statues, where gruesome rituals are performed. Slaves are sacrificed in droves, their blood ceremoniously spilled to consecrate these crude idols. The savages believe that this sanguine offering permits their demon gods to inhabit the statues as vessels-a grotesque notion as no proper God would live in a rock. Yet, one cannot entirely dismiss the reports that an oppressive aura lingers around these monuments after the rituals."

descr "Inspired by the success of wolf riders in battle, some ambitious goblins set their sights on an even bigger prize-the moose, the largest creature in the forest. After much trial and (mostly) error, a few managed to befriend these massive beasts. The moose proved to be a ferocious asset in combat, charging into enemies with wild abandon. The goblins, however, quickly discovered they had little control over their mount, often clinging for dear life as the animal rampaged. To compensate, Moose Riders now carry bows, allowing them to at least fire a few shots during the rare moments when the moose decides to stay still."

descr "Though Trolls and Giants are not known as deep thinkers, the Ettin Wyrd hold a strange place of reverence among them. With two heads and opposing temperaments, they speak in riddles, contradictions, and ambiguities, a tendency not unknown among the faculty of this College. One head, it is said, always tells the truth; the other lies without end. The challenge, of course, is telling which is which. They have been observed channeling opposed magical forces, one aligned with stillness, the other with storm, though in a rather chaotic fashion while they bicker over whose turn it is to hold the staff. Some scholars argue the entire duality is a fiction, and that both heads are equally mad. This, all things considered, remains the safest assumption."

It is possible to tell a Mimic apart from an ordinary piece of furniture by touching it, as it is quite slimy. The slime is sticky and will make it difficult to move and escape from the Mimic, even though a chest shape is badly suited for movement.

descr "The Black Pharaoh was once a great ruler, but his devotion to Nyarlathotep and the Outer Gods led his kingdom to ruin. His reign was marked by strange and horrifying rituals, driving his people into madness as he sought to bring his otherworldly masters into the mortal realm. Eventually, his kingdom collapsed under the strain of the collective insanity and the crushing cost of constructing his great Pyramids. Long lost to the sands of time, the Black Pharaoh has now been summoned once more to serve the Thousand-Faced God."

descr "Among the Dwarves, it is the eldest councilors who bear the responsibility of preserving the rich history of their kind. Their memories, extending well beyond their natural lifespans, suggest something rather extraordinary-a collective consciousness that seems to transcend the individual. In many ways, the Dwarves function much like a hive, each member contributing to the whole, not as a singular entity, but as a part of something larger. Much like ants within an anthill, their role is defined not by individuality, but by their contribution to the collective."

descr "A rare and remarkable phenomenon, the exodus of dwarves from their city resembles the behavior of a migrating bee swarm. If the colony becomes untenable, the dwarves may abandon it en masse. The Dvala is carried by her most trusted drones, ensuring her safety. As they move, they methodically collapse tunnels and destroy critical infrastructure, preventing any potential reoccupation by enemies. The dwarves then embark on a perilous journey, to establish a new settlement where they can rebuild and thrive. The relocation is highly stressful to the Dvala, and she will neither heal injuries, perform complex rituals or spawn new eggs in the outside environment."

descr "A rare and remarkable phenomenon, the exodus of dwarves from their city resembles the behavior of a migrating bee swarm. If the colony becomes untenable, the dwarves may abandon it en masse. The Dvala is carried by her most trusted drones, ensuring her safety. As they move, they methodically collapse tunnels and destroy critical infrastructure, preventing any potential reoccupation by enemies. The dwarves then embark on a perilous journey, to establish a new settlement where they can rebuild and thrive. The relocation is highly stressful to the Dvala, and she will neither heal injuries, perform complex rituals or spawn new eggs in the outside environment."

descr "The Vespertine Courts are shadowy tribunals operating under the authority of the Holy Church of El. Meeting in secret, these courts pass judgment on the accused in absentia, relying on collected evidence, rumors, or divine revelations to determine guilt. Their rulings are swift and absolute and carried out by unseen agents. These courts claim to uphold divine law, rooting out heresy and corruption where traditional justice falters. However, their clandestine nature and lack of accountability have bred fear and suspicion. Whispers of fabricated charges, and politically motivated trials abound, though few dare speak openly against them."

descr "The Ether Ray is a peculiar being of the void that resembles a giant manta ray. Its underside glows with shifting patterns, thought to serve as a means of communication. Ether Rays are believed to be filter-feeders, consuming stray motes of magical energy and smaller etheric creatures. However, if threatened, they are fully capable of defending themselves with a physical tail stinger. While their movements appear calm and elegant, their mere presence disrupts reality, causing strange phenomena to ripple through the air around them."

descr "Hobmark folk tales warn of a headless horseman who haunts the country roads at night. He carries his severed head in one hand and rides a ghostly stallion. If he sees you, he'll call your name-just once- and thereby claim your soul. The superstitious Hobmarkers insist this ominous figure is Death himself, out for a midnight ride. Probably this is just bedtime bogeyman stories cooked up by the Markgraf to keep folks obedient to the curfew. If seeing the rider means certain death, who is left to tell the tale?"

descr "Spending my first night in Wickermoor Hall, I thought the stories were just that-stories. But as the fire burned low, the sound started: a skittering, soft at first, then like claws raking bone. The walls seemed alive, shifting with something just beyond sight. I swear I heard whispers between the scratching, a hissing voice not quite human. When dawn broke, the room reeked of damp and rot, and there were footprints across the floor around my bed. From rats maybe, but larger than any I have seen. I left that morning, but even now, in silence, I hear them whispering, gnawing and waiting."

descr "Toxicology was once regarded as a promising field of study among the Hoburgs. The idea was simple: if one could understand poisons and their effects, surely that knowledge could be reversed to create cures for the same ailments. Unfortunately, very few cures ever materialized, but instead, toxicologists became disturbingly skilled at crafting even deadlier toxins. Eventually, the academy banned the discipline altogether, declaring it a hazard rather than a science. However, toxicologists found a new home in Markgrafdom, where their talents were not only welcomed, but encouraged."

descr "It is well known that Hoburghers are like sheep; and prefer to eat, travel and fight in large flocks. The similarities doesn't end there however. Like sheep they scare easily, especially if alone. Thus there are very few scouts defending the hoburg armies from ambushes and bandits. Instead the Hoburghers rely on their numbers and seek comfort and safety from their flock. This has made Hoburghers popular targets by clever bandits who take advantage of their sheep-like mindset and scare them into forming tight groups of frightened Hoburghers unable to efficiently defending themselves."

descr "Thaddeus Galvanicus' breakthrough in vivisection demonstrated the reciprocal relationship between living tissue and electricity. He famously proved that a jolt of lightning could make a frog twitch, and under rare circumstances, a twitching frog might produce a small spark of electricity. Building on this discovery, the nekromants managed to power a clockwork arm by attaching it to a living goat. However, after a chaotic experimental process, they concluded that soulless were far more practical as far as power supply goes. ^This corpse is adapted with a complete mechanical exoskeleton, including clicking metal claws, ingeniously powered by animal electricity."

descr "The Alchemical Corpse was the first product of an interdisciplinary collaboration between nekromants and toxicologists. The initial plan conceived by Amadeus the Thrice-Rejected, was to turn a student of the Great Academy into a walking bomb. Upon approaching the Headmasters' Council, the bomb would detonate, releasing a mind-bending poison to place the council under the Markgraf's control. In the end pragmatism prevailed, and a simpler design was selected. This corpse is adapted with a complete mechanical exoskeleton, and a large container of vitriolic acid in the chest cavity. It will explode upon contact with anything it deems an enemy, which in practice can mean anything. Do not stand in front."

descr "For the travelers who have had the opportunity to observe both Hoburg and Hobmark troops, the Markgraf's units often appear as bleak copies of the Hoburg troops.  However, there is a difference when it comes down to the Hoburg Hussars.  The original Markgraf, being a pig farmer himself, went into painstaking efforts to set up his own elite of hog riders.  The Hog Hussars are more lightly armored than the Hog Knights, sporting only a light cuirass and favoring a Hobmark sabre, making them deadly as they circle the enemy footsoldiers. ^This one has signed an Extended Service Contract and will continue his employment with the Markgraf beyond death."

descr "The disappearing skulls of the buried academy members where quite a conundrom for a while. The cause became obvious when the visage of the late dean of pyrotechnics appeared wobbling on top of an ungodly five-legged construct. Apparently the nekromants had maintained a grave-robbing ring and had been hording 'special heads' for quite a while. While not really sentient, the severed head appears able to maintain control over a monstrous amalgamation of iron and flesh. The exhaust on its back spews sickly green miasma, choking the air with plague and rot."

descr "Thaddeus Galvanicus' breakthrough in vivisection demonstrated the reciprocal relationship between living tissue and electricity. He famously proved that a jolt of lightning could make a frog twitch, and under rare circumstances, a twitching frog might produce a small spark of electricity. Building on this discovery, the nekromants managed to power a clockwork arm by attaching it to a living goat. However, after much trial and error (and considerable chaos), they concluded that soulless workers were far more practical. This ritual equips 10 Little Soulless with clockwork weaponry".

descr "The Alchemical Corpse was the first product of an interdisciplinary collaboration between nekromants and toxicologists. The initial plan conceived by Amadeus the Thrice-Rejected, was to turn a student of the Great Academy into a walking time bomb. Upon approaching the Headmasters' Council, the bomb would detonate, releasing a mind-bending poison to place the council under the Markgraf's control. In the end pragmatism prevailed, and the alchemical soulless were simply made to explode on contact with the enemy."

#---------------------- Scourge Lord Monster Descriptions --------------

# Many descriptions rewritten. No references to breeding pits, and the writing is cleaner. 

selectmonster    "Myrmecoleon"                                              
descr "The Myrmecoleon is a conundrum of nature. Somehow, someone appears to have managed to get a lion and an ant to mate. It is assumed that the pairing must consist of a male lion and an ant queen, as no other combination would produce such a fearsome creature. We have not, however, been able to deduce why the front is that of a lion and the back and legs those of an ant. If the Myrmecoleon follows the same laws as a centaur, we can conclude that the nobler part is made up of the head and torso, whereas the legs and lower body come from the lesser of the two creatures combined. I assume that one can use this rule to calculate the nobility of the different parts of a chimera. However, many scholars are still occupied with the question: is the sum of the parts more or less noble than the origin?"

selectmonster    "Apophis"                                                 
descr "Sometimes the Scourge Lord is mistaken for one of the many snake cultists that roam the countryside, due to the large snakes they sometimes summon. However, this is obviously false, as the Scourge Lord would never worship anything but his own ego. The Apophis is a beast of terrifying size, and it is not really known how it reaches such dimensions. It is said that they feed on large amounts of rotting meat. However, our own experiments with force-feeding snakes to obtain similar specimens have thus far been unsuccessful. Wickham the Naturalist was severely poisoned in the last round of experiments."

selectmonster    "Monster Scarab"                                          
descr "It is not known why the Monster Scarab rolls enormous piles of dung, but it is no surprise that the Scourge Lord allies himself with this most vile of creatures. The Monster Scarab, when not employed by evil forces, moves along an indiscernible path, rolling an ever-growing, perfect sphere of dung before itself. Some lower creatures, like the goblins and their kind, believe that our world is a gigantic ball of dung rolled forward by an enormous beetle, and that the dung balls the ordinary Monster Scarabs roll are just smaller worlds with smaller creatures. That theory is, of course, nonsense-as was proven when Philomena the Sage excavated such a ball and found nothing other than maggots, worms, and smaller insects. The notion that we are all maggots may be suitable for a lowly goblin, but it is, of course, an absurd notion when it comes to humans. A more scientifically sound theory is that the dung ball reflects the scarab's close affiliation to the element of earth, and that by gathering dung and dirt in a ball, they create what is in essence the egg from which the next scarab is born. It has also been proposed that, since they are one of the one hundred and three known abominations, they are hiding their appearance from El behind that great ball."

selectmonster    "Scourge Worm"                                            
descr "Our informants tell us that the Scourge Worm is beckoned to serve the Scourge Lord with the use of a cadaver broth. The broth, with its stench of rot and devastation, acts as a lure for any nearby vile creature already infesting the scourged lands. The Scourge Worm usually inhabits the rotting carcasses of large monsters-the larger the monster, the larger the worm."

selectmonster    "Dark Centipede"                                           
descr "One of the classic rot dwellers, the centipede can usually be found under rocks and in old walls, eating anything decayed. The Dark Centipedes are far larger and are sometimes found in dark cellars and abandoned ruins. Due to their size, they can no longer hide under small rocks, but instead need to take shelter in caverns or beneath partially collapsed floors."

selectmonster    "Dark Serpent"                                             
descr "The snakes and serpents of the defiled wastelands sometimes exhibit almost demonic traits. The Dark Serpents are not only venomous; they are somehow also imbued with dark powers, which allow them to emit spell-like effects. We believe the most reasonable explanation lies in a combination of exposure to venomous vapors and the corrupting influence of the Scourge Lord. If one lives their entire life in a swamp, the cold and slimy humors will affect the brain, leading to laziness, apathy, and evil. The snake produces such ill fumes each time it attacks a foe, thus immersing its own brain in foul air. A brain thus saturated in venom becomes extraordinarily susceptible to malignant forces. When exposed to the Scourge Lord, the poisoned brain begins to project evil onto its perceived enemies."

selectmonster    "Basilisk"                                                 
descr "A basilisk is the unnatural result of the mating of a snake and a black rooster. Such occurrences are, of course, rare, but if a cockerel can be convinced to brood a large toad or snake egg, it is only a matter of keeping it still for twenty-seven days before the unholy union produces a terrifying monster."

selectmonster    "Hyena"                                                    
descr "The Hyena is a wicked beast and an eater of corpses. It is said that they are the reborn souls of sick and elderly persons who were told jokes so bad they choked and died of laughter. Thus, the Hyena laughs as it feeds on their relatives' corpses, mimicking their voices in mockery. Some evil men tame the beasts and keep them as pets, using them to mimic and ridicule their guests. If provoked, the guests will surely be slain and consumed by the mirthful beasts."

selectmonster    "Black Ant"                                                
descr "The basic giant ant. It usually resides within the anthill, carrying food or materials, and building or repairing sections of the hill. It is thought that they may serve as a useful basis for polymorphed slaves, or perhaps as the brains of slave constructs. However, all attempts to do this have ended disastrously, and further discussions of ant-driven constructs are discouraged by our wise dean."

selectmonster    "Black Soldier Ant"                                        
descr "The soldier ants are formidable fighters and are known to take on creatures far larger than themselves. They are usually more than a match for any creature of equal size, so do not bet on a dog in a dog-vs-ant fight.^Their powerful carapaces are highly sought after by many adventurers, who prefer them over steel or iron. However, being rather difficult to manipulate and reshape, they are often crafted into scale-like armor.^The ants seem to prefer fighting in formation, which is odd, given that their natural habitat is the narrow passages of the anthill, where they live and fight in defense of their colony. This requires further research, and I have requested a stipend to capture twenty or so soldier ants, which I will compel to fight other creatures under various circumstances in the arena.^Note to self: find someone willing to paint the ants in different colors."

selectmonster    "Scourge Ant"                                              
descr "The Scourge Ant is the ordinary black soldier ant, warped by defiling magic. This gives them an extraordinary hunger for human flesh and all things living. They should serve as mindless slaves to the Scourge Lord, but more often than not, the Scourge Ants act independently, roaming the countryside in search of prey and larders to plunder."

selectmonster    "Scourge Ant Queen"                                        
descr "An unlikely ally of the Scourge Lords is the horde of ants that often infest their realms. While the Scourge Lord is a creature of chaos, the ants prefer order-even if that order brings chaos to common folk, who do not appreciate having their larders emptied by aggressive insects.^Though summoned by the Scourge Lord, the Ant Queen acts independently, devoting herself to the construction of a grand anthill from which she spreads her own dominion. The ants soon expand outward, often causing as much disruption to the Scourge Lord's territories as they do to the surrounding countryside. Indeed, they have even been known to plunder and consume villages belonging to the Scourge Lord himself."

selectmonster    "Spiderling"                                               
descr "Nothing good can be said of a ruler who includes spiders in his armies. Regardless of size, the legs, the skittering, and the crawling all make it clear what sort of army this is. The Scourge Lord takes particular joy in seeking out the largest and most repugnant specimens-a task he likely attends to personally. This unhealthy obsession with spiders is a true reflection of his twisted soul."

selectmonster    "Black Spider"                                             
descr "This giant arachnid grows to the size of a large dog and is most commonly found in dense, shadowed jungles. Like its smaller kin, it has eight hairy, unnervingly swift legs. It preys on wild pigs and explorers alike, capturing them in thick webs that slowly dissolve the flesh into a sort of corpse broth.^Bizarrely, some local populations have developed a taste for the partially dissolved pigs or goats recovered from the spider's grasp. These people typically lead the animal into the webs and return a day later to retrieve the carcass-ostensibly to avoid eating a lost explorer by mistake. The webs are said to tenderize the meat and impart a curious sting to the tongue.^The creature also boasts hundreds of beady eyes and powerful mandibles more than capable of rending flesh. Why anyone would attempt to tame such a monster is beyond comprehension."

selectmonster    "Scourge Spider"                                           
descr "Reports indicate that the Scourge Lord has begun employing magical giant spiders. This is, naturally, an abomination. I recommend we stockpile fireballs and meteors and reduce that part of the realm to ash."

selectmonster    "Guardian Statue"                                          
descr "It is common for spellcasters to construct guardians to defend their property while they are away. These are typically large statues imbued with a portion of the caster's power. As constructs, they offer better value than hired soldiers and require no sustenance or pay, provided they remain within the confines of the laboratory, cave, or ruin they are meant to protect.^Constructing such guardians demands caution, as demonstrated by the many occasions on which Zhakra the Ancient forgot her own password-leading to incinerated books and apprentices alike.^The Scourge Lord's statues, like all his creations, lack refinement or artistic merit. Instead, they are slathered in gilt and gaudy decoration, a poor substitute for true craftsmanship."

selectmonster    "Scourge Flame"                                            
descr "In a feeble effort to mimic the elemental masters, the Scourge Lord has bound a flame to wood steeped in defiling magic. The result is a sickly green fire-utterly inferior to pure flame, which cleanses taint and disease, unlike this foul imitation, which spreads them. A person afflicted with plague, when burned in pure flame, will have both the illness and any impure thoughts consumed by fire. Sadly, this usually includes the body as well."

selectmonster    "Scourge Wind"                                             
descr "The Scourge Lord seems intent on mastering all elements, though only through perversion and corruption. Flames and winds have already been twisted to his ends, and there is some evidence of dominion over earth, as seen in the desolate wastelands he leaves in his wake.^Yet in his efforts, a flaw remains: he has failed utterly to corrupt water. This may well be the key. The Scourge Lord-and all who serve him-must be drowned."

descr "The desert warriors are nomads often seen serving the dark powers of the southern deserts, their skill of traveling quickly and unseen through the sands is uncanny. They rarely stay together for longer than one raid, unless some great warlord is paying them, usually a Scourge Lord or Rakshasa. They are a cowardly sort and prefer to stay back and let the unholy monsters take the frontline."

descr "At times the Scourge Lord will assume so much power and land, albeit withering at this point, that he will call himself a King, and thus is often mentioned in the journals as a Scourge King. ^This, however, is a faulty view as the title of king requires both a bloodline and a righteous claim on the throne, as is true with the most noble benefactor of our university. The Scourge king ought rather to be called a Scourge Usurper, Despot or Tyrant. I would personally choose to use the title of Scourge Usurper. ^In order to appear more majestic, the Scourge King often uses magic and simple tricks to enhance that in which nature has failed him. Special shoes will make him look taller, golden dye and skillful combing will cover any grey hairs or bald patches, and through illusory magic any blotches on his skin are covered. The blessings he bestows on his minions are likewise a mocking facsimile of true divinity, and certainly also just another deception."

selectmonster "Scourge Herald"
hp 22 #from 18
lifeforce 1
desert
descr "Though the Scourge Lord is fickle and paranoid, he will often surround himself with sycophantic assistants who will lead his troops and help spread his influence.^These assistants are the Scourge Heralds. Not only do they engage in the crimes of more common villains, such as robing merchants, taking over villages and mines, harassing the local population and killing the innocent, they are also the main instrument by which the Scourge Lord depletes the landscape of Elysium. The Heralds will erect pillars and steles whose surfaces are inscribed with inscriptions of power. Through these pillars the Scourge Lord drains the surrounding lands of all their lifeforce, leaving a withered desert behind them."

selectmonster "Scourge Lord"

desert
descr "A few times each century, the menace that is the Scourge Lord reemerges to plague the realms. Hidden behind spiky armor and a golden mask, he gathers other destructive forces and begins a reign of chaos and ruin. The source of the Scourge Lord's powers remains unknown and a topic of much debate. It has been suggested that the secret lies within the mask and the armor, and that the Scourge Lord arises whenever a simple adventurer or farmer of low nature unearths the golden mask. It is easy to imagine how the future Scourge Lord dons the mask, disregarding any pieces of crumbling flesh still clinging to it. Within the mask, and now its host, lies the power to drain the lands, leaving them desolate in the wake of the Dark Ones passing."

descr "Once every few generations, the Scourge Lord rises again to spread chaos and ruin. Clad in spiked armor and a golden mask, he gathers destructive forces under his banner, leaving entire realms in devastation. The source of his power remains a mystery, though many believe it lies within the mask itself. Some say the Scourge Lord is not one man but many-that whenever a hapless adventurer or lowly farmer stumbles upon the mask, their doom is already written. It is easy to imagine how the future Scourge Lord dons the mask, ignoring the scraps of withered flesh still clinging to its edges. And with that single act, the cycle begins anew, as the mask and its new host drain the land, leaving ash and desolation behind."

# Verbatim from CoExp: "OG one gets a mask and sword. I assume you want to know how this works? Okay, the vanilla one can only be gotten via mastery which shifts the ID -1 to the old SL sprite version. This one is defined here and can be referenced with "1:Scourge Lord" like in the maincom definition and the 'get back in the game' recruit. Therefore, this new sprite is found via those means, the old one by mastery only."

descr "It is widely known that mercenaries will sell anything or anyone if just paid enough. it is also a common fact that they should not be paid before an executed job as their loyalties are fickle. However, the Scourge Lord offers almost anything the mercenaries will ask for if they just sell their soul and take part of the dark life force collected by the Scourge Lord. Though many eagerly accept, hoping for loads of gold, few are aware of the cost. After they have undergone the transformation they will become stronger, but find themselves craving human flesh, rather than gold or the items once precious to them."

Their touch is lethal, and their horrifying appearance so dreadful that anyone who meets their gaze is instantly turned to stone. These creatures dwell in the desert, their lairs easily recognized by eerily lifelike stone statues-remnants of their unfortunate victims. Laurenzio the Sculptor once dared to steal one of these statues and present it as his own work. His masterpiece earned him widespread acclaim for his extraordinary skill. However, when he ventured back into the desert to retrieve a second statue, his luck ran out. Today, it is said that Laurenzio's own striking likeness stands among a grim collection somewhere in the deep desert."

descr "A Herald, or the Scourge Lord himself, constructs a huge stone pillar and inscribes it with runes of power, creating a Pillar of Power that drains life force from the surrounding lands. The life force is channeled to the Scourge Lord who will use it to empower his agents or summon beings of manifest destruction. Forests and settlements give more life force than plains. Mountains and hills give very little life force and deserts are devoid of life force. With time the surrounding terrains will wither and eventually turn into deserts. Oceans have less life force available, but cannot wither away. A settlement that is under the influence of an active Pillar of Power will produce ghouls that gather at the pillar, awaiting their master's call. The Pillar can drain up to 15 points of life force from the surrounding lands. If there is more life force available the excess will not be drained until some lands have withered away."

However, mammoths still trample smaller animals whenever they can, though this behavior appears to be more for fun than necessity."

descr "We all occasionally look up and allow our imagination to create faces, animals and beasts from the clouds lazy drifting across the sky. You might even imagine buildings, castles and soldiers of you stare hard enough. This might be thought of as childish imagination, but the truth is that there are people living in the clouds, themselves formed from vapor and mists. Due to the Laws of Similarity their lives correspond in every way to ours. Kings and barons rule with wisdom and priests teach divine truths, great ships sail between cloud islands and monsters stalk misty forests and fields. Like all things made of clouds, they are fleeting and insubstantial- illusory, perhaps even. But if you see a cloud shaped as a dragon, it is wisest to run."

descr "We all occasionally look up and allow our imagination to create faces, animals and beasts from the clouds lazy drifting across the sky. You might even imagine buildings, castles and soldiers of you stare hard enough. This might be thought of as childish imagination, but the truth is that there are people living in the clouds, themselves formed from vapor and mists.

Kings and barons rule with wisdom and priests teach divine truths, great ships sail between cloud islands and monsters stalk misty forests and fields.

descr "A Nimbus Conclave is a floating platform formed of living thunderclouds and controlled by en ensemble of Cloud Lords. First seen during the Second War of the Eagle, these stormy citadels laid siege to the Imperial Cities, raining down lightning and chaos. Peace was only achieved thanks to the timely intervention of Sofrates the Sage. 'A ridiculous waste of time' he called it, and in now famous display of philosophical discourse, he eventually convinced the Eagle Kings and Emperor to agree. The transcript of their discussion was published as the Swan-Banquet Trialogues, which we highly recommend to all students of the Academy."

descr "The Silent Kings are ancient Cloud Lords, said to have transcended the cycle of reincarnation through spiritual achievement or simply by refusing to leave. Their preserved forms sit upright on alabaster thrones in the highest spire of the Cloud Palace, where the air is thin, dry, and entirely still. Great windows open onto the cloud realm below, offering a clear view of the lands far beneath. ^Their presence is revered, and on rare occasions they are consulted by the ruling elite-typically when the matter is unusually complex, obscure, or difficult to settle by more conventional means. Answers, when given, tend to be sparse and largely symbolic. In times of great peril, a Silent King may be roused and carried forth from the tower on a ceremonial carriage. The event is regarded as both a blessing and a logistical nightmare. Should the body be lost in battle, it reappears days later in the same chair, in the same position, facing the same window."

descr "The Black Kobolds exhibit notable deviations from the typical behaviors of their kind. Whereas most Kobolds show little interest in wildlife beyond the draconic beasts they revere, the Black Kobolds display an unusual affinity for large spiders. Indeed, they are occasionally observed riding these arachnoids into battle. However, let us not mistake this behavior for courage or strategic . Rather, it is a reflection of their inherently craven nature and insect-like disposition, which aligns them more closely with the lesser creatures of Elysium."

In desperation, his people buried him and his nine wives deep underground, out of sight of the Gods. Yet the Gods were not satisfied. All memory of the king and his deeds was erased, and he was cursed to live eternally in darkness, forgotten by the world he sought to rule."

descr "It grows in a cavern beneath the earth, rooted in a fungal forest of pale stalks and creeping molds. Its flesh is thick and wet, and across its cap, slow-growing spirals form patterns that seem too regular to be natural, though their purpose is unclear. The air is dense with drifting spores. Those who come close report hearing something, not as speech, but as thoughts shaped by something older than language. The Pale Ones say it grew from the corpse of a buried god. Others say it dreams, and that its dreams are felt wherever roots and spores have taken hold."

descr "The Way of the Sun and Moon teaches balance through the harmony of opposites. The masters of this tradition, reside in a secluded monastery above the clouds, untouched by the world below. Through years of discipline, these ascetics have pushed the limits of the body. They need little food, live for centuries, and survive wounds that would kill ordinary men. Trained in lung-gom-pa and levitation, they move with a grace that seems beyond human ability."

descr "The incredibly rare Giant Wizard is a living proof that in the ages past the giants used to be more than barbaric brutes. Others suggest that it's just a hill giant who ate some smaller wizards and absorbed their power, but that seems unlikely, as we've never seen ogres or ghouls manifest magical power, even after consuming deceased spellcasters.  While he has little in common with human mages, he benefits from being a giant, and is as such impossible to assassinate with anything short of a ballista salvo."

descr "The appearance of Soulless among shipwrecks and tidal graves has raised certain questions within the academic faculties. While spontaneous undead are well documented near graveyards or battlefields, the occurrence of sea-borne Soulless in the absence of an animating will remains less understood. One prevailing theory holds that seawater, having passed through innumerable corpses, may retain some faint property of death. In sufficient concentration -such as within the hull of a sunken ship- this might permit the reanimation of drowned bodies, provided the flesh remains suitably intact. The theory further posits that the water acts not as a necromantic agent itself, but as a medium through which residual necromantic essence may propagate. Alternative explanations involve the hypothetical presence of an underwater necromancer, a figure the Academy remains eager to engage in scientific dialogue. To encourage such an encounter, several waterproof placards have been affixed to coastal stones and driftwood, each bearing particularly stimulating hypotheses in magical theory. These efforts are supplemented by a long-running bottle campaign, in which carefully penned theses and polite invitations are set adrift under the Academy seal. Thus far, no response has been recorded, but it is hoped that intellectual curiosity will eventually outweigh whatever instinct for secrecy such a practitioner may possess."

descr "The Giant Hermit Crab is a solitary and unusually deliberate species, often mistaken for driftwood or debris until it begins to move. Unlike its more aggressive cousin the Giant Crab, the Hermit Crab displays signs of problem solving behavior, and according to frustrated fishermen, holds grudges. It selects its shell with great care, frequently repurposing shipwrecks, broken statues, or even outhouses, and will defend it with surprising tenacity. It has been known to revisit coastal villages that disturbed its scavenging, sometimes flipping boats or dragging off gear with what appears to be quiet satisfaction."

descr "Sea anemones and garden anemones are entirely unrelated species. If one wishes to distinguish between them, scent is usually sufficient: the garden variety has a mild floral fragrance, while the sea anemone lives underwater, and attempts to smell it will result primarily in water entering the nose.^^It is equally important to differentiate between the ordinary sea anemone and the giant sea anemone. The former is small and only modestly hostile; the latter is significantly larger and known to consume unwary sailors. Reports of faint sea shanties heard near the larger specimens have been noted, though these are generally attributed to nerves or low morale."

descr "Drowning was once the standard procedure for managing meddlesome crones. This had unintended consequences as some, it turns out, thrived underwater. In hindsight this should have been expected.  By the time the modern concept of witch burning was introduced, it was already too late. Slimy and soaked in saltwater, Sea Witches are notoriously difficult to set alight."

descr "Void Larvae are the immature forms of Horrors, birthed in places where the veil between worlds has thinned. Like all horrors, they feed on sensations and gestate in places of suffering and despair. Their presence alone can disturb dreams or cause the weak-willed to weep without reason. It is believed that Void Larvae are not truly alive in any mortal sense, but fragments of thought or will from deeper realms."

descr "Every so often the Dwarven mines are beset by ogres, trolls and even giants.  As a last line of defense, there is a mixture of guards and arbalests lining the main chamber.  This is usually only a way to postpone the inevitable, should the giants have reached that far.  However, from time to time a lucky Dwarf might get a fortuitous shot against a giant's head, felling the foul beast.  Should this happen, the Dwarf is immediately taken away, given some privileges and training and set to man some of the ancient ballistas.  A Dwarven ballista need not hit the head in order to defeat a giant.  Despite being vital to the defense of the mines, some have been taken out from the mines in order to be used in sieges against our castles and cities."
