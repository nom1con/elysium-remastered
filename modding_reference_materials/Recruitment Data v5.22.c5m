#                      COE5 RECRUITMENT DATA IN MOD FORMAT
# 
# This file contains the recruitment data (for both classes and terrains) for
# CoE5, extracted from the executable.  Although this file is not actually a
# mod, its contents adhere to CoE5's modding format in order to make it an
# optimal resource for modders.
# 
# This file provides examples of how base game class recruitment lists can be
# built using modding commands (although some class recruitment lists in the
# base game do use some commands that are not available to modders) and
# templates that modders can use to create their own class recruitment lists. 
# Unfortunately, despite the addition of the recterr command in CoE v5.12,
# terrain-based recruitment the way the base game does it (which generates
# offers regardless of class) is still not accessible to modders, but you can
# at least see here how it works in the base game.
# 
# Everything to the right of a "#" (such as what you're reading now) is a
# comment, which means the game ignores it; it's there as a note for human
# readers (i.e. you).  I've provided comments toward the right of many lines to
# explain various things, but there's too much information to fit it all there,
# so some of it will go here, instead.
# 
# There are three different commands that can start a recruitment offer:
# addunitrec, addmercrec, and addcomrec.  Following each selectclass command
# (which starts a class recruitment list), there's a comment line establishing
# the headers for columns, like this:
# 
# #                                               % No gold die iron
# 
# The columns hold the numerical values (arguments) that accompany the
# addunitrec, addmercrec, and addcomrec commands.  The "%" column is the base
# chance each turn for that offer to appear.  The "No" column is the number of
# units that will be recruited with that offer.  The "gold" column is the base
# gold cost, while the "die" column is the size of an open ended die (see the
# game manual if you need an explanation of what open ended means) rolled to
# determine additional gold cost each time the offer appears.  The "iron"
# column is the cost in iron.
# 
# Here's an example of an addunitrec command:
# 
# addunitrec  "Tower Guard"                     100  5   50   0   15
# 
# This means that every turn, there will be a 100% chance of an offer to
# recruit 5 Tower Guard units for a cost of 50 Gold and 15 Iron.
# 
# addmercrec works very similarly, except that the offer's text in the Recruit
# menu will be green, and both the "once per offer" and "extra" flags will be
# set, meaning that the offer can only be purchased once, in one citadel, each
# turn it appears, but it will not use up that citadel's recruitment for the
# turn.
# 
# addcomrec is much like addmercrec (including the "once per offer" and "extra"
# flags), but the unit will have commander status and the "No" column will be
# empty (it isn't needed because an offer for a commander can only ever recruit
# one unit).  The text will again be green, unless the unit allows the owner to
# gather a special resource, in which case the text will be blue, instead.
# 
# If a line begins with "# " followed by a word in [], that means it's a
# command that isn't accessible to modders.  The word in [] is my guess at what
# Illwinter might call that command if they did make it accessible to modders. 
# I present these as comments because they don't have mod command names that
# the game would recognize (so to adhere to the modding format, I need to tell
# it to ignore them), but the part that's actually intended for humans to read
# is the second comment, to the right.

#                     Class Recruitment List Modding Maxima
# 
# Each class's recruitment list has reserved space for 128 offers.  Each offer
# consists of one addunitrec, addmercrec, or addcomrec command, with room to
# follow that command with templerec, libraryrec, atavirec, 2 recxcost
# commands, 8 reclimiter commands, and 1 recterr command.
