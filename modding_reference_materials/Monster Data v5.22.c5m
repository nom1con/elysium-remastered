#                        COE5 MONSTER DATA IN MOD FORMAT
# 
# Please be aware: the Monster Data is a work in progress.  Most of the common
# commands are translated, but many other commands are currently unhandled.  In
# most cases, I already know what they mean, I just need time to add them to
# the app.  I plan to continue working on it as time permits, but I don't have
# much free time, so expect this to be a project that takes years.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# This file contains the monster data for CoE5, extracted from the executable. 
# Although this file is not actually a mod, its contents adhere to CoE5's
# modding format in order to make it an optimal resource for modders.  That
# said, much of the information here can be useful to players, as well.
# 
# For modders, this file provides examples of how base game monsters can be
# built using modding commands (although some monsters in the base game do use
# some commands that are not available to modders) and templates that modders
# can use to create their own monsters.
# 
# For players, this file provides detailed information on each monster's stats,
# weapons, and special traits.  In addition to being a time-saving reference,
# it also includes information that isn't visible anywhere in game, with
# examples including which monsters have traits like Disease immunity or Void
# Sanity, and how frequently and how far dragons will move from their mines.
# 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
#                           INFORMATION FOR PLAYERS
# 
# Everything to the right of a "#" (such as what you're reading now) is a
# comment, which means the game ignores it; it's there as a note for human
# readers (i.e. you).  I've provided comments on the right-hand side of most
# lines to explain what all the modding commands on the left actually do, so if
# you're not a modder, you can pretty much ignore most things on the left and
# just read the comments.
# 
# The major exceptions are:
# 
# -Lines beginning with newmonster.  The part between the "" is the name of the
# monster; the comment with the number on the far right is the monster's index
# number, which you can ignore.
# 
# -Lines beginning with descr.  The part between "" is the description shown in
# game when you right-click on the monster.
# 
# -For basic stats, the comment gives the name of the stat but doesn't repeat
# the value of the stat, since that's just to the left of the comment.
# 
# -Commands whose names and meanings are especially obvious generally either
# don't get comments, or don't repeat the command name at the start of the
# comments, for the sake of brevity.
# 
# -Comments for weapons include the name of the weapon (which can be used to
# look it up in the Weapon Data for more information) and some brief
# information about it, but I don't repeat the modding command used to call the
# weapon (e.g. meleeweapon, prebatweapon, rangedweapon25).  These commands can
# have important effects on how the weapon works for that monster, but I don't
# explain them in the comments.  See the modding manual for that information.
# 
# If a line begins with "# fx", "# res" or "# move" followed by a number, that
# means it's either a command that isn't accessible to modders, or I haven't
# taught the app to translate it yet (or both).  I present these as comments
# because they don't have mod command names that the game would recognize (so
# to adhere to the modding format, I need to tell it to ignore them), but the
# part that's actually intended for humans to read is the second comment, to
# the right.

descr "It takes a strong man to rule in Elysium and the Baron is very strong.  It is said that he has defeated a Moose in single combat and decorated his mantelpiece with its head.  The Baron is also from a noble lineage and owns the strongest castle in all of Elysium.  His noble blood inspires the common people with awe and no one of common blood would dare disappoint him.  Most other nobles ride horses into battle, but the Baron prefers to stay on foot.  That way he can swing his magic greatsword, which has been handed down from father to son for generations."

For this protection the King charges a quite hefty fee, as this protection is hard to provide in a place like Elysium.  The King's knights and soldiers are not always strong enough to beat the evil forces that roam Elysium, but they are certainly strong enough to beat down any noble who refuses to pay."

It may be that the rate of gold production is not a real limit, but rather a restriction imposed by the guild to prevent too much gold from being created.  Regardless of the real reason, the Alchemists claim they cannot produce more gold than they already do."

They are of noble birth or at least ennobled land owners, and of sufficient wealth to provide themselves with the finest armor and steeds.  The abundance of unclaimed land in Elysium makes it possible for the Baron to create many new nobles who in turn will provide him with knights and soldiers."

newmonster    "Unicorn Knight"                                           #   25
descr "Elysium has many creatures that would make much better battle mounts than a horse, but unfortunately none of them have turned out to be sufficiently friendly to be tamed.  However, there is one exception, the Unicorn.  The Unicorn seems to have some defect that makes it like young girls, so by sacrificing a young girl, it is possible to gain this truly magnificent beast as a mount.  The magic of the Unicorn rubs off on its rider and makes him immune to poison and he will recover from wounds at an amazing speed."

descr "The wizards who have learned some kind of magic on their own, or perhaps from another untrained mage, are called Hedge Wizards.  Their control of magic is rudimentary at best as they lack all the theoretical knowledge needed to master the art.  The magic of the Hedge Wizards is often tainted by the influences of Nature and the spells they manage to learn are usually limited to what Nature can influence."

descr "The Archmage is the eternal headmaster of the Academy of Higher Magic and Elemental Powers.  The Archmage is a position appointed for life and the Archmages have all been highly skilled at magic and tend to live for a very long time.  In addition to bad hearing, very old age for mages comes with the more serious problem of madness.  The reign of the previous Archmage, Gustafus, ended spectacularly after he was convinced horrors had infiltrated the Academy and then blasted it to rubble with a mighty ritual."

Their original countries are still unknown to most civilized people but descriptions by adventurous explorers of Barbaricum, with its uninviting lands and unpleasant climate, its dreary aspect and its social gloom do not invite travels into those areas.  The many tribes claim to all originate from one of the many sons their deities are supposed to have birthed.  Still to this day some of these tribes quarrel over the birthright of these ancient gods. 
 Notwithstanding considerable local diversities, their land as a rule consists of tangled forests and dismal swamps, the rainfall being greater on the side towards the larger mountains.  They choose their kings for their noble birth and their generals for their prowess.  The king's power is neither unlimited nor arbitrary, because as in most of the simpler nations, it is tangled in tradition."

descr "The generals owe their authority less to their military rank than to their example and the admiration they engender by it, if they are dashing, if they are conspicuous, if they charge ahead of the line.  This has often led to foolish onslaughts in which several groups charge ahead against the enemy at the same time.  A general who does not panic in the face of such an onslaught can use that very trait against them, and instead provoke the differing enemy units to fight one another for the chance to reach the enemy first.  As each chief only leads troops of his own kin, they are loyal to the chief, but have nothing against slaughtering allied troops, which is why old battlefields of Barbarian wars are the joy of any scavenging Necromancer."

descr "Even iron is by no means abundant with them, as we may gather from the character of their weapons.  Only a few have swords, and those who carry a sword are considered to have higher rank than a warrior with an axe.  They make no display of ornament, only they are very careful in the colors they use for the devices on their shields.  Few possess such a thing as a breastplate, and only a man or two here and there a helmet or headpiece.  Their line of battle is drawn up in wedge-shaped columns; to fall back, however, provided only a man comes on again, is held to be good tactics, not cowardice.  Even in a defeat they carry off the bodies of their comrades.  Throwing away the shield is the crowning disgrace, and a man who has so dishonored himself may neither take part in the rites of religion nor enter the general assembly; many such survivors from the battlefield have been known to end their shame by hanging themselves."

Here lie dignity and strength.  From a surviving slave who managed to flee after serving as a captive for the Barbarian Leader, strange tales about some of these bodyguards have been recorded.  It is said that some of the most honored bodyguards at times of great omens are fetched by some of the oldest Enaries to a sacred place in the forest, where they must crawl through the skin of an old Bear while the priest covers them with tattoos and markings.  Upon returning, their mind is different and they become grumpy and solitary.  It is said that they now are possessed by the spirit of the Bear, and can take that shape during battles.  Some reports have described small tame Bears fighting on the Barbarian side in battles, but nothing indicates that they were once humans."

Being confined to a smelly hut, those seeking counsel are first questioned by the younger Enarie and only if the question is deemed grave enough would one be allowed in.  If the leader is fatally ill, a triad of younger Enaries will ask the spirits for names of oathbreakers in the village.  One of those names given will be summoned and thrown into the hut of the Elder Enarie.  If the villager's soul is that of an oathbreaker, the Elder Enarie will strike a brass plate and the now sleeping villager is fetched to be sacrificed for the health of the leader."

descr "Once the Spirit Guide reaches maturity they will be initiated into the deeper mysteries and are no longer forced to eat their monthly herbs.  However, some still do, because it is difficult to end such a habit.  The more powerful ancestral spirits are still driven by a greed for gaudy objects, so the Enarie needs to dress up in shiny accessories.  In order to gain the ability to see the ancient spirits, the Enarie must consume certain strong, poisonous mushrooms that grow near the Troll cesspits.  Without preparation it is far too strong to consume, and could even be fatal to the Enarie.  Instead the mushroom is ground and mixed into strong beer.  The beer is then given to the village drunk, who will readily drink it.  After degrading himself to the amusement of the village, his pee is collected in wooden jars and stored for a week before the Enarie drinks it.  The poison is now so diluted as to only give the Enarie strong visions of all the spirits around them."

descr "The Barbarian priests claim that they once learned some of their powers by possessing and consuming an elderly Troll Shaman.  As it regenerated  within the bodies of the Enaries, they managed to use their ancient powers to trap the Troll within them, thus absorbing not only the strange powers of the Troll but also some of its mind.  Ever since this event, the Spirit Guides and Enaries have assumed the role as the Holy Mother of their tribe.  Others claim that the Barbarian tribes were once ruled by a group of holy priestesses that entered a sacred marriage with the Barbarian Leader.  In order to hold on to their power the Spirit Guides have to assume the role of priestesses too, which is why they are now both male and female, both Spirit Speaker and Priestess in the same person.  It is not known if they still keep the tradition of the royal marriage, though. During the full moon the Spirit Guides are given a strong concoction of bitter and poisonous herbs, which gives them sharp pains in their abdomen."

descr "To omens and the drawing of lots they pay the very greatest attention.  Soothsayers among the Barbarians are numerous and their method of divining by the lot is simple.  They lop a branch from a fruit tree and cut off the twigs; they mark these differently in order to distinguish them apart, and they then cast them loosely, at haphazard, on a white robe.  Then the priest of the community, if it is going to be a public divination, or if a private one, the head of the household, offers a prayer to the gods, and turning up his eyes to heaven he draws three twigs, one at a time, and he interprets those which he has drawn according to the marks previously set upon them.  If the interpretation proves to be unfavorable, no further divination on the same question takes place that day.  If it is favorable, the auspices have still to be consulted."

newmonster    "Senator"                                                  #  138
descr "It is recorded that when the last Imperial benefactor of this College, Emperor Dentatus III was assassinated by the commander of his Praetorian Guard, the Old Empire fell into a long civil war that eventually led to its dissolution.  Local leaders set up their own small kingdoms and dukedoms.  Where other leaders carved out new titles and orders for themselves, the ancestor of the current Senator was a strict adherent to using proper paperwork.  Because there was a lack of legal precedence to dissolve an empire, the Senator was stuck with both his title and the ways to properly run his province.  With the Senator representing the Empire, our College could still receive some small funding from the Senatorial State.  However, lately the costs of the scribes that have to handle the paperwork to obtain the stipend have far exceeded the stipend itself, and some argue that we should stop applying for it.  The rather strong chapter of scribes has so far refused any such suggestion.
Though some of or records still mention the Imperial Capital, its exact location has been lost.  All explorers who have set out to locate the Capital have expired due to hostile Trolls, Deer and Ghosts.  Our records have only given vague references to the whereabouts of the capital, and according to a theory formulated by Crispina, some of the evidence suggests that it was accidentally teleported in an attempt to restore the Empire through complex magical means.  Recent reports indicate that the current Senator again has Imperial ambitions, and should he find the Capital, he might even choose to proclaim himself the new Emperor. "

descr "Though lost for generations, the realm has now seen the rise of a new Emperor.  After defeating the Capital, a week long revelry with many daily hecatombs being sacrificed and wine given out to high and low, a hungover and decimated population of the Capital arose to meet a newly proclaimed Emperor.  One of the first actions of the newly inaugurated Emperor was to issue coins with his portrait.  Our archives reveal that this was fully in accordance to tradition, and despite voices refuting his claim, we have come to conclude that the Emperor is legally appointed.  Our archivist can also share the good news that the Emperor is considering becoming the new benefactor of this college.  Our faculty of scribes is now fully involved with the task of filling out the proper forms for the transition to Imperial authority."

descr "Several philosophers argue that all it that is needed to attain godhood is to have enough people believe that you are divine, while others claim that you need to possess some kind of divine spark to begin with.  However, following the protocol of earlier Emperors, recording each decree in three copies and allowing for citizens to refute his claim at the gladiatorial pits, and after issuing a myriad of statues dedicated to himself, the Emperor has now issued a decree according to which he is to be worshiped as the Divine Emperor.  Though this might be a good opportunity to study a transition into godhood, the Department of Divine Studies has been reluctant to send for a request for some of the Divine Imperial flesh."

descr "Though lost for generations, the realm has now seen the rise of a new Emperor.  After taking back the Capital from the undead, a week long revelry was proclaimed and wine was given out to high and low.  According to tradition the inhabitants of the capital should celebrate the Emperor, and could they rise from their graves they would undoubtedly celebrate the new Emperor.  One of the first actions of the newly inaugurated Emperor was to issue coins with his portrait.  Our archives reveal that this was also fully in accordance to tradition, and despite voices refuting his claim, we have come to conclude that the Emperor is legally appointed.  Our archivist can also share the good news that the Emperor is considering becoming the new benefactor of this college.  Our faculty of scribes is now fully involved with the task of filling out the proper forms for the transition to Imperial authority."

newmonster    "God Emperor of the Underworld"                            #  144
descr "A difficult legal dilemma arises whenever a property owner becomes undead and is not driven by any urges to attack and devour their relatives or any passer by.
In theory your zombified uncle may very well hold onto your rightfully inherited tavern, and unless he is permanently dead your inheritance cannot trigger. This was the unfortunate result of the case of Malea vs Feodorus, in which it was declared that an undead person is not dead in the views of property laws.
Other cases have proven that unless the undead have an intent for malice, slaughtering them is considered remurder and may make your property claims invalid. Certainly this is a debated legislation, and lately we have seen a rise of misuse of the rulings, as old spiteful relatives let themselves be zombified upon death in order to avoid passing on their properties.
This is bad enough when concerning a property, but it can be disastrous when applied on a whole empire. In 437 the Emperor Vasilis the putrid, conquered the fallen capital in the underworld and proclaimed himself God Emperor of the Underworld. Now it is a given that the God Emperor will take on the body of a titan as he extends his rule into infinity, still just like with the lesser undead, the questions of inheritance and chain of command remains, so his move was followed by quite a severe time of turmoil.
Being divine in this manner gave him a long reign that outlasted many relatives, but also made mundane concerns of the empire seem less important than a constant supply of sacrifices and entertainment in the form of senatorial debates to the death.
This was also the cause for the fall of the second empire after which Elysium suffered from what is called the second dark ages."

newmonster    "Statue of the Underworld"                                 #  145
descr "In ancient times the Emperor would have put up statues of himself in any major settlement.  This has often been described as an act of vanity by many historians.  However, a few opposing theories have been put forth.  By sharing his image in both statues and coins, the Emperor would be present in the mind of every citizen.  When such an awareness reaches a certain level, it would give the Emperor a sort of divine focus or divine aegis if he so desires.  This can then be redirected and focused through the statues and there has been speculation that it would keep the citizens calm, giving them a sense of being watched at all times - which would explain the elaborate eyes in many statues."

descr "The Senatorial army is strictly divided in units of predefined size, power and equipment.  The Centurion leads a centuria, the base army unit in the Senator's army.  A centuria may never exceed nor fall under 100 soldiers.  Should there for any reason be a lack of men, the Senator has set up a system in which future soldiers are listed to the centuria.  Thus a centuria will always consist of 100 legionnaires.  When the soldiers are conscripted, they will then be issued a name and background according to those already listed.  As this process does take some time, the legions of the Senator can be  a bit slow to muster.  The most striking example of this procedure emerged after the battle of Phylotermae where one of our couriers noticed how one of the centurias consisted of a Centurion, three men and a large pile of parchment scrolls containing the names of the soldiers-to-be. The three surviving soldiers had quite a hard time setting up tents for their as yet non-existent comrades."

descr "It is said that the Sun Cult requires its members to contribute generously in order to gain access to the deeper mysteries of the order.  For some reason they have gained many wealthy followers who have quickly risen in the ranks.  It is true that the Cult is not without a certain political influence, something that may have attracted some of their new followers.  Their militaristic views have also made them quite popular among the soldiers, which is why they have had no problems in setting up certain elite squads consisting of experienced soldiers who get a quick introduction to the mysteries of the cult.  Their leaders are said to be favored by the sun, and seem to often comes from wealthy families without either martial experience or a lineage that would give them a chance to command.  The Leo contributes the armor of his entire unit, which has provided the local bronze smiths that are part of the cult with good business opportunities.  The commander himself is dressed in a polished bronze plate decorated with a an image of a lion surrounded by a flame-like mane.  Some say that he is also given the ability to channel a minor aspect of the solar powers of the priests.  At his side and dealing with the everyday duties of leading the unit is one of the senior soldiers."

descr "One of the more important cults in the imperial army and legal courts is the Cult of the Conquering Sun.  Initially it was a cult whose adherents were clerks, judges and other scribes who need daylight for their work, but lately it has won more and more influence in the Senatorial armies.  Today their priests claim that the sun and the presence of its priests will lead to unprecedented victories.  They started their rise to prominence in the armies  a few decades ago during the wars against the rebellious Necromancer Solidorus, against whom the powers of the Heliodromi were exceedingly efficacious.  Any connection between Solidorus and a local chapter of the Sun Cult has been deemed by a legal court to be unwarranted rumors bordering on slander.  The order is still struggling to construct a good theological solution to why there is night if the sun is invincible."

descr "Renatae are part of an ancient order of Magi and Magae that officially study the mysteries of life, water and bodily fluids.  They are also keepers of most of the genealogical records of the province.  In return for a generous donation to the order, they can find a prominent past for almost any citizen.  This has led to some legal problems with two families claiming the same line of ancestry.  They are rumored to also try to influence present bloodlines through marriages with the right families, through manipulation of lineages and even through forgetting to record some less fortunate incestuous couplings.  Many of the Renatae end up married into prominent families and some have even married into the Senatorial family in the past.  Many of the Renatae have joined the order at a young age, hand picked from different families across the realm.  Because they are often married into powerful families, few parents refuse the request of the Renatae to induct their children into the order."

descr "Known to everyone as the oldest of the order of Renatae, the Renatus is a keeper of records, the preserver of magic and the end of a family line bred for their magical abilities.  Though his magical abilities do not exceed that of other mages in the realm, he has somehow stumbled upon the path to immortality through a combination of  alchemical residues, a strong magical affinity, a strict frugal diet and celibacy.  The latter two have kept most alchemists from trying his path, claiming that there must be an easier way.  Hieronyma the Clouded claims that it would be impossible achieve immortality this way and that they have instead come upon a way of copying the body and mind of the Renatus that makes him seem immortal.  According to her the old basins under the main palace of Renatae are filled with innumerable copies of the Renatus, ready to be sent out should the previous copy die.  Though the Renatus seems to be the oldest and most powerful member of the order, there are claims that a secret coven of old Renatae governs the order with the goal of creating the perfect human.  Though there is no substance to such rumors, many heroes have bragged about how they have succeeded in seducing a local Renata."

At this point the cult was also embraced by the Emperor, who outlawed all other snake cults.  Today the Great Snake seems to be sleeping and most people consider the cult to be just an archaic remnant of the Old Empire.  However, according to some legal documents they can still claim to be the official cult of the Empire.  In the resolution of a recent lawsuit initiated by the Solar Cult, it was concluded that rather than being the sole official Imperial Cult, it is the official Serpent Cult of the Empire, which allows any other types of cult to be freely established.  Being a rather archaic cult, the Serpent Cult chooses its acolytes from among a small group of families whenever a child is born carrying the traditional Sign of the Serpent – flaky skin, split tongue or parietal eyes."

newmonster    "Serpent Priest"                                           #  153
descr "Having been a part of the Empire for a few hundred years, the traditions of the Serpent Cult are quite well known.  After their initial thirty years as an acolyte, which mainly involves feeding the snakes, polishing the temple silver, or cleaning out the latrines, the Acolytes are promoted to the rank of Priest.  Originally there was some test to weed out the ones who were unworthy, but the diminishing number of Acolytes has forced them to elevate all Acolytes to Priests, and the Great Snake is only fed with slaves these days.  The Serpent Priests are mainly taking care of the city snakes, but are also responsible for interpreting the snakes' desires and choosing the snakes' consorts among the city slaves."

newmonster    "Pontifex Serpentis"                                       #  154
descr "The most senior of the Serpent Priests are sometimes elevated to the rank of Pontifex Serpentis.  The ritual of elevation to the post of Pontifex includes commanding a host of smaller Snakes and Serpents to form a bridge across one of the major rivers in Elysium.  If the priest survives he will immediately be taken to the main temple of the Snake Cult, where the newly appointed Pontifex is trapped within the main hall for thirteen months together with the Great Serpent.  Each day a fire is lit by the Pontifex and if grey smoke rises from the temple roof the pontifex is still alive.  Should black smoke rise, the Pontifex is dead and his ashes must be collected.  Should white smoke arise at the end of the thirteen months, the Pontifex will have surpassed the ordeal of the Great Serpent.  The Pontifex will then be freed, ready to rule the cult.
 Exactly what powers the Pontifex wields is hidden in the mysteries of the Snake Cult, but it is said that he can take the shape of a large snake.  Some rumors say that the Pontifex must mate with the Great Serpent in order to create a new Snake, which would explain why so many of the old Pontifices have been devoured by the Serpent."

descr "While the Empire, or presently the Senator, and every subject under his rule represents the civilized world, there are some who seem to succumb to chaos.  At certain times each year, during the Lupercalia, some men and women, strangely enough mainly clerks, lawyers, merchants and Lictors, shed their clothes and run into the woods to participate in decidedly carnal orgies.  Though some seem to be filled with an uncontrolled lust for these activities, others join just for the thrill of it.  However, these orgies are quite overrated, with cheap wine, aching bodies and pine cones in places best left unmentioned.  Those who are truly afflicted by this madness seem to be filled with some strange power and when they find the right place for these festivities, ancient sites of chaos can be stirred."

descr "It seems that at times the feasting of the uncontrolled revelers will plant a seed of chaos at certain ancient sites, reawakening the forces of old.  Though we do not make use of such beings anymore, some Satyrs have been lured to join the armies.  They are particularly attracted by the chance for a carnal encounter with either men or women.  They are the first of the ancient beings to arrive at the site of the revelers' orgies, and then join passing armies just for the fun of it.  Satyrs are lewd, obnoxious and generally a pest to the surrounding landscape, prone to break into wine-cellars and seducing anyone they come across.  The best option is usually to fool them into your enemy's realm."

descr "After one of the ancient forests has been dedicated to chaos and debauchery, some of the female revelers will be overcome with chaos, transforming into murderous beasts, devouring and butchering any man that they come across.  It is said that this affliction will remain and they are usually not allowed back home.  Instead the madness will grow and they will search the plains for any man who walks by himself late at night.  Neither rank nor heritage will protect the lone traveler from the hunger of the Maenads.  Hexapodes, the renowned arachnologist, has pointed out that a similar pattern of behavior can be found among certain spiders and insects, and has suggested that the Maenads are in fact suffering from some kind of parasite."

descr "In old times any construction of bridges and temples as well as any declaration of war demanded a sacrifice of a hecatomb to the Elysian pantheon.  An Elysian hecatomb is one hundred sheep, some of which may be goats instead as long as they can be kept under control.  The sacrifices were performed by the Flamen, who wielded considerable power at the time.  In order to balance that power, the Flamen was limited in several ways and still is.  He may not touch iron, meat, beans or living horses.  He is always required to wear the Flamen headdress, even when sleeping, and he may not look at an armed army.  Some of the more creative Emperors of old added to the lists of what a Flamen could and should do.  After the gods had demanded a particularly vast number of hecatombs from Emperor Reus IV, the Emperor ruled that when the Flamen spoke on non-religious matters, he had to bow to the senior member of the Senate between each syllable. 
 With new cults appearing, these sacrifices became less and less important, and today the Flamen's sacrifices mainly concern less important things, such as weddings, the inauguration of a new porch and similar events.  However, the restrictions still remain, which is why it is a rather unpopular position.  It is now generally given to the member of the Senator's council who arrives last at the yearly Senatorial meeting."

descr "The Senators have always used different ways to try to predict the outcome of an upcoming war, a predecessor's pending death and similar important questions.

Several tomes have been written on the subject of how to interpret different birds in different times of the year.  The flight of the birds is considered to reflect the winds and the messages they carry between the gods.  This is of course utter nonsense, as most learned people know the future can only reliably be read through the liver of a Goat that has roamed freely in the area in which one aims to predict a possible outcome.  The closer to the subject that it has grazed the more accurate the predictions will be."

descr "After serving half their contracted time of 25 years, the legionnaires who have survived that long and not proven themselves completely useless will be promoted to Princeps.  Like the Hastati, they are armed with javelins and gladii, their signature short swords.  In the ancient Empire they were issued long spears, but after an incident in which an inept Acolyte of the Serpentis Cult tried to disarm the enemy with a spell that turned long wooden objects into snakes and the barbarians still had their long knives, the army renewed itself.  Principes armed with short swords rather than long spears are also less likely to dismount a mounted Senator who visits the army camp."

descr "If a Princeps returns for a second term, or if someone can afford to buy themselves a heavier armor when joining the army, they are instead given the rank of Triarius.  As such they are issued a large shield and a pike.  The Senatorial treasurers have concluded that it would be disastrous for the economy to put these troops into the fray, allowing them to die like the less armored legionnaires.  Instead, they are, according to the economic directive, placed in the back lines of any legion, pushing the greener recruits forwards with their pikes."

descr "Last year a record was set with a Standard Bearer surviving for 14 months, the previous record being just under a year.  While it is indeed an honorable and, for a soldier, well paid position, it is also usually of quite short duration.  There have been those who have suggested buying an automata from some Enchanter to do the same job.  But experiments have proven that automata do not have a positive effect on the troop morale and are difficult to give counter orders once the battle has started.  A disastrous experiment with standard bearing automata was performed at the horrendous battle of Griffon Gorge.  In an attempt to engage the inferior enemy, the legion tried to cross the river at a known crossing point. Halfway into the crossing scouts noted that the ground had been undermined and the officers ordered a halt.  However, the standard bearing automata trudged on and so did the rest of the legion, pressing the front troops out into the river or into the trap.  The return of scattered remains of the legion and an unscathed automata proved another disadvantage with not using a proper soldier, because the automata could not be punished afterwards.  The Enchanter was of course later charged with and found guilty of reckless spending of Imperial resources.  Today most Standard Bearers are Gladiators who have a rather short life expectancy anyway."

descr "Today the gladiatorial games are a cheap imitation of what they once were.  What has been described in Imperial literature as a sophisticated, subtle art has been replaced with cheap tricks to entertain the masses.  In the past the gladiatorial fights were made to simulate the great battles of the Empire, and Gladiators were dedicated to the art of fighting.  In this day and age all they talk about is money, fame and freedom.  Still, a Gladiator is a worthy fighter and upon gaining their freedom many are given the chance to join the army as an auxiliary or special troop."

descr "Lately the managers of the gladiatorial games have tried to spice up the fights with Gladiators dressed up in outrageous arms and armor – ant helmets, griffon beaks and even mule skins are donned by the combatants.  In the past the only difference would be the local armor of the different combatants, but the masses of today are too easily distracted and need some kind of show.  One of the more popular costumes is that of a fisherman, complete with net and trident.  While it provides the masses with some cheap laughs, it has risen to such popularity that some even manage to win their freedom.  O tempora, o mores."

Since they cannot be charged with unlawfully entering a home, they have often been sent to investigate the personal belongings of political enemies of the Senator.  This freedom has also meant that the Praetorians have helped themselves rather freely to food or other things from the homes of many citizens.  However, for a small fee the Praetorians will protect you instead."

descr "While the present martial focus of the Solar Cult has made them quite popular among the soldiers, that is not the case of their elite guard, the Principes Solares.  Recruited from among the more experienced soldiers and given shiny new suits of armor, they consider themselves better than most other legionnaires.  It appears that they are given some introduction to the Cult from both their commander and some of their senior colleagues in the squad.  Though the mysteries of the Cult are unknown to anyone outside it, they do seem to stress other aspects of the teachings than the priests.  Though a ban of dice games could possibly be interpreted by what the priests says, the collection of protection money from younger recruits or the joy they take in burning down buildings, tents, fields or even people does not seem to correspond to anything the Heliodromi say."

descr "In ancient times the Emperor would have put up statues of himself in any major settlement.  This has often been described as an act of vanity by many historians.  However, a few opposing theories have been put forth.  By sharing his image in both statues and coins, the Emperor would be present in the mind of every citizen.  When such an awareness reaches a certain level, it would give the Emperor a sort of divine focus or divine aegis if he so desires.  This can then be redirected and focused through the statues and there has been speculation that it would keep the citizens calm, giving them a sense of being watched at all times - which would explain the elaborate eyes in many statues.  It has even been argued that the statues at times would shoot lightning towards unruly subjects.  Though that is a mere bedtime story today, it would explain some of the darkened burnt spots in plazas near such statues.  A more reasonable explanation for the statues is that they would represent the Emperor regardless of any troops being present or not, and the settlement cannot fall until the statue is removed.  This is the current policy of the Senator, who has tried to reclaim some cities where such statues still stand by suing them at a local court."

# [named]     "Azazel"
descr "In a primeval era of antiquity the god Ba'al incarnated for the first time and made the world taste fear and destruction.  Even Angels succumbed under the sway of his will and sinned.  Azazel was the leader of the Watchers and the first one to be seduced by the will of Ba'al.  He convinced his brethren to join him and they swore a pact that they would all commit to sin.  The Watchers took wives among men and begat the Nephilim, giants of almost godlike power.  When the Celestial Powers lashed out in fury, the Watchers were banished to the Infernal realms where they still linger, fettered by bonds of iron tempered in the blood and tears of those slain by their gifts of civilization."

descr "In a primeval era of antiquity the god Ba'al incarnated for the first time and made the world taste fear and destruction.  Even Angels succumbed under the sway of his will and sinned.  They fell to lust and took wives among men.  Their offspring became the Nephilim, giants of godlike power.  These Fallen Ones were cast down and imprisoned in the Infernal realms for their sins, but the Nephilim were partly of this world and could not be banished by the Celestial Powers.  The Nephilim made themselves kings, and they fathered sons who became known as the Rephaim.  The Nephilim had unnatural appetites and devoured all that their servants could produce.  When food became scarce, they consumed beasts, men and finally their own offspring.  When Ba'al left this world, the Nephilim found that they had no comparison under the Heaven above and they lost their purpose and the will to rule.  Leaving their sons to rule, they left the land to find purpose and meaning to their existence.  Now the priestesses of Ba'al have called them back with blood and a purpose."

It likes to trap humans in its web and let a few drops of poison kill them slowly.  It then watches their agonies with its many eyes and skitters around in anticipation.  Just like most many-legged beasts, the Large Spider is an excellent climber and can scale any surface."

descr "Venomous fangs, skin as hard as stone and a multitude of eyes and legs makes the giant spider very frightening.  It is so scary that even other beasts are afraid of it, which makes the giant spider sad.  The bear doesn't seem to mind, though, and often shares its lair with the giant spider.  You should not feel sorry for the spider, however, because it attacks on sight and it is as deadly as it looks.  Hiding behind a city wall will not work either, because the giant spider can run up any wall with ease."

descr "The Lesser Demon was probably meant to be a superior combat demon.  It has many limbs for extra attacks, three legs so it cannot be tripped and its mouth located on its torso so that it can have room for more eyes in the face.  Unsurprisingly, it turned out to be a misfit, even for a demon.  It is less powerful than all but the Imps and therefore it is named Lesser Demon."

Luckily Hellhounds can be bound by the same magic that is used to bind demons."

descr "Abaddon, 'Destruction', is one of the demon lords and ruler of the Abyss, the outer reaches of the Inferno covered in eternal darkness.  His body is that of a compact shadow and he is only partly in this world.  Abaddon is the lord of the Demonic Locusts and the prophets of El claim that he will lead them in the final days of the Apocalypse when Elysium is shattered and the faithful will be brought to the celestial plane.  Abaddon revels in torturing lesser demons that have not lived up to his standards, or just because they were unlucky that particular day."

descr "Most grown up necromancers can be divided into three major groups. The brooders who dress in black, seem incessantly moody and prefer the company of death. Occasionally the brooders will try to revenge a forgotten old slight by raising an army of the undead and march upon the settlement where the perceived wrongdoer lives. Another common necromancer is the person who has lost a loved one and tries to revive her. As most will not be content with a mindless rotting version of their loved ones they often have to isolate themselves studying the undead. Of course as they most often only will end up with a rotting mindless creature anyway, they will go quite mad. The third group of necromancers is made up of people lacking friends and who try to create them through a horde of undead. Who has not seen the deranged student of magic talking to an animated doll or even plain air. It is far worse seeing the disturbed necromancer talking to a host of rotting corpses."

descr "Necromancy is generally considered one of the lesser arcane arts, but it is a good start for young students of magic. I guess We all had some fun with reanimating simple things during our apprenticeship years, and it was only a few years ago that we had a craze in which every child was to have their own reanimated mouse or sparrow. But childish pursuits do not fit the grown up mage so there is no wonder that the necromancer in general is an unbalanced and unstable creature. Actually the apprentices are often more useful than the real necromancers as their chores might have kept them too busy to develop a weirdness of their own."

descr "The Longdead are so called because their bones have lain long enough in the ground that worms and other corpse-feeders have gnawed away most of the flesh.  While most longdead are the result of necromantic practices, there are numerous reports of skeletal remains walking about without necromantic leadership.  While tempting, most of us have discarded the idea that the bones of mortals carry memories, and independent longdead arise when the memories of the bones have been weakened enough to forget that they are dead, but remember how to walk.  This Dementia Theory is at least more attractive than the Bored Bones Theory that claims that everything is inhabited by a spirit, a spirit that can become bored with lying around immobile and therefore animates the vessel it inhabits, in this case a set of unfleshed bones."

descr "Assembled bones, regardless of size, seem to have an affinity for walking about. Boredom or forgetfulness are possible but unsatisfactory explanations for independently moving skeletal remains. If boredom was the cause, the bones of the giants of old should be more prevalent. Having spent millennia buried in the ground would likely be unimaginably boring. However, through necromantic rituals the bones of trolls and other giants sometimes appear where least expected, such as at the gates of the Markgraf's fortified hoburg."

descr "Unburied dead can be put to use by those who know the Dark Arts.  A fresh corpse makes a more sturdy vessel than the naked bones of the Longdead, but is still susceptible to holy energies.  While not as common as necromantically independent Longdead, there are Soulless that appear near cemeteries and haunted cities, regardless of the presence Necromancers.  The Dementia Theory suggests that independent Soulless are less common because the flesh of the newly dead is a greater repository for memories and the flesh is commonly the part of the body that experienced the process of the dying.  Thus the post-mortem dementia has less effects on a body less decomposed and spontaneous Soulless are less common than spontaneous Longdead."

newmonster    "Shade Beast"                                              #  350
descr "The Shade Beast is a hideous apparition, summoned from its native realm and bound by Necromancy.  Its mindless stare puts fear into the heart of men and its fangs are imbued with Stygian power.  Anyone killed by a Shade Beast is reanimated by the Stygian energies released when the spirit is ripped from its dying body.  Shade Beasts roam the Shade Lands of the Underworld, much in the same way as Deer roam the forests and plains of Elysium.  Well-traveled Necromancers can attest to their cunning and sudden attacks on newly conquered Stygian settlements.  While not universally accepted, there is a theory that the Shade Beasts are in fact the spirits of dead wildlife."

descr "The curse of vampirism brings inhuman strength and magical power.  If a Necromancer is unwilling to give up certain pleasures of the flesh, vampirism can be preferable to lichcraft.  Although inferior in magic, the strength of blood can be quite useful for more physically demanding tasks.
The Vampire Count is a Vampire risen high in the ranks of his kin."

descr "With lichcraft, the cunning Necromancer can prolong his life almost indefinitely.  A practical side effect is that most bodily needs present in life no longer take time from studies of the Arts.  The husk of the Lich is quite durable, although over the years some deterioration is inevitable.  Especially the upper and lower lips seem susceptible to decay, which is of little consequence apart from making some incantations a bit harder to utter correctly.  The procedure also requires the heart of the Necromancer to be hidden safely away from enemy mages and would-be heroes."

Unlike the Carrion, the Dracolich will not reassemble.  Nor does it fly."

Fortunately, inventive necromancers have found the means to perform vicarious exhumations, freeing the dead titan from the binding earth of Hades and summoning the spirit to Elysium where it will serve its new master. Having spent eternities buried in Tartarian soil the spirit have become a powerful wielder of both stygian and chtonian magic. The spirit still wields the chains used to bind it in Tartarus, as a reminder that it still is a slave."

To stop them from destroying the pristine lands, they were imprisoned in glacial ice by primal forces.  The Unfrozen have now been freed and bound by a Necromancer.  The Unfrozen have bony, leathery bodies that withstand damage well.  The Unfrozen lived in clans led by chieftains and powerful mages."

descr "Made from rotting vines, putrid mushrooms and the remains of woodland animals that have met an untimely death in the forest they roam and attack anyone who dares to approach them.
In the old days they were made by petty village enchanters to steal milk and annoy their neighbors. When the ritual is carried out on a single animal, it is hardly even magic, but just a very strong case of spite. Which is proven when some people that have been accused of constructing these small abominations lack both the magic ability and the mental prowess to do anything else in the magical field. They cannot even make themselves float when tested by the priests of El.
But when the Troll Mother learned of this trick, she went big, and soon the forests were filled with these disgusting creatures."

It is possible to tell a Mimic apart from an ordinary piece of furniture by touching it, as it is quite slimy. The slime is sticky and will make it difficult to move and escape from the Mimic, even though a chest shape is badly suited for movement."

newmonster    "Warlock's Apprentice"                                     #  441
descr "Warlocks are mages of limited power who study Elemental Magic.  Due to their limited scope of understanding, they usually surrender to, rather than harness, the magic of the elements.  Any wise practitioner of the magic arts can see that this invariably leads to tragic results.  When a young mage meets a powerful Warlock, he might believe that the powers of the Warlock are his own, but in reality they are borrowed or lent from the Elemental Lords.  When the young apprentice has gained a little knowledge, he is able to form pacts with the elements and summon elemental beings to serve him.  But in order to gain more powers, the Warlock must form a pact with one of the elements, rejecting the opposite Element.  This clearly shows how limited the arcane understanding of the Warlock is."

newmonster    "Warlock of Earth"                                         #  448
descr "Warlocks are uneducated second class mages who study Elemental Magic.  To gain magical powers, they make pacts with the Elemental Lords.  But Warlocks are not true mages and the powers gained from these pacts are limited.  Since the Elemental Lords are at constant war, it is impossible to form powerful pacts with more than one of the elements.  The pact will limit what elemental beings a Warlock can summon and many Warlocks use apprentices with weak pacts to compensate.  The apprentices are taught how to make lesser pacts and summon elementals opposite of the element of their master.  If a Warlock signs a greater pact with an Elemental Lord, he will lose the ability to cast any rituals except from his chosen element."

newmonster    "Great Warlock of Earth"                                   #  449
descr "The Great Warlock is a power to be reckoned with, despite his limited arcane understanding.  Given vast powers by his Elemental Lord, but immature of mind, he is likely to wreak havoc and wanton destruction upon civilized men.  Therefore it would be prudent to put any aspiring Warlock to the stake before he can muster enough power to form such a pact.  The fact that the Great Warlock can no longer cast rituals of the other elements has led some of them to form conclaves of Warlocks who serve different elements.  Fortunately there is still a strong animosity between the elemental forces, if not between the Warlocks themselves."

descr "The most powerful inhabitants of the Elemental Plane of Fire are the Fire Giants, primordial beings of tremendous strength.  As warriors and guardians of their fiery realm, they wield flaming swords imbued with elemental power.  They live in castles of bricks and bronze, surrounded by moats of molten metal, and only leave their abodes to wage war upon the other elemental realms.  Like all inhabitants of the realm of Fire, the Fire Giants have difficulties entering the Planes of Water and Ice, but should they meet denizens of those realms in Elysium, they are likely to attack on sight."

descr "Most Trolls like damp places at some stage in their life, but some Trolls just can't get enough of it and start to live in lakes instead of the usual damp cellars.  As Trolls normally can't breathe water, it is assumed that the Trolls would die underwater if it weren't for their regenerative powers.  But after a long time underwater even a relatively daft troll should have learned how to breathe water properly.  Just like normal Trolls, the Lake Trolls can be quite aggressive and it is advised to stay well away from their favorite lake.  Tossing a gold coin into the lake is not recommended as even a Troll might figure out that the person throwing away perfectly good gold could have more coins on him."

The worms are seldom seen despite their size, but on rare occasions they can be sighted when they come to eat some of the delicious sand that can be found in the deserts of Elysium.  However they usually spend their time deep below the surface of Elysium, but those visiting the deep earth cannot miss the work of the worms as they walk in the vast empty caves left in the wake of the enormous worms.  Modern research proves that it was the Purple Worms that ate the parts that later became Inferno.  The devils settling there forced the worms to move closer to Elysium, where they currently reside and are likely to do so until something very powerful wants their newly created caverns for itself."

By dying the Witch picked up some traits from the dead and is now more powerful than ever.  Should the Bog Witch be slain, she will simply reform her body in another swamp and live on yet another time.  The only way to slay her is to cleanse all swamps from the Witch's influence and then slay her, no easy task."

newmonster    "Monster Snail"                                            #  538
descr "The size of a snail is only limited by how much food it has eaten. The monster snail is extremely large and has thus eaten an extremely large amount of food. This rarely happens in the wild, but if a farmer leaves his food storage unchecked for many months, a single hidden snail might have eaten all his harvest and grown to an exceptional size. These huge snails are very dangerous and unlikely to leave the food storage voluntarily. Make sure to check all food storages for snails at least once a week."

descr "The Gorgons might be mistaken for regular women, if you disregard the fact that great leathery wings sprout from their backs, and that tresses of vipers grow from their heads instead of hair. You should refrain from any closer inspection though. Gorgons seem to like statues and sculptures and can sometimes be found in old temples, where such expressions of vanity were common in ancient times. The Gorgons are supposedly three sisters and immortal as a rule."

descr "A Doppelganger can take just about any shape, yet it seems to really like shapes with many tentacles.  The most reasonable explanation for this is that the Doppelganger is some kind of land octopus and thus using tentacles in combat comes naturally.   Unlike the victims of ordinary octopuses, those killed by the Doppelganger's tentacles will transform into small heaps with many tentacles."

Helping the beasts is surely an act of evil, but no one can deny that leading the animals is a great feat of magic as the beasts of Elysium have strong souls and are not easily swayed."

descr "Even though it is smaller than most of the other beasts, the Wolf is still strong and has sharp teeth that make it deadly in combat.  The Wolf mostly hunts at night and attacks anyone foolish enough to sleep in the wilds without a sufficient number of guards keeping watch.  When traveling in the northern territories, people are taught to avoid the Deer during the day and to look strong during the night to keep the Wolves from attacking."

descr "This impressive looking beast has sharp teeth, large antlers and a sinister mind.  Many hunters have tried to chase a lone Deer through a forest only to find themselves surrounded by an entire herd.  This never ends well, because the Deer is a very fast creature and it shows no mercy to its prey.  Even though Deer are aggressive when they are hungry, they are also very clever and seldom attack armed men unless they outnumber their prey.  Contrary to what many people believe, Deer do not need to eat humans, but can survive entirely on forest berries and mushrooms."

The Moose is not as aggressive as its smaller cousin the Deer, but you should still be careful.  If there are no tasty trees nearby, the Moose will not hesitate to satisfy its hunger by eating a human instead."

descr "The Bear may not be very bright, but it is larger and stronger than most other creatures and gets along very well with all the other beasts.  The Bear likes potatoes more than anything, so if you encounter a Bear, it is good to have a potato to throw in the direction you are not running to.  It has happened many times that a group of Deer joins forces with a number of Bears in order to attack a fortified town.  The Deer then have the strong Bears break down the gates.  The surviving people have returned later only to find half eaten corpses on the streets and all the potato stashes plundered by the Bears.  During the winter the Bear spends most of its time napping and will not bother anyone who is wise enough to stay away."

descr "Smartest among the beasts, the Serpent is not one to be trifled with.  It is an excellent climber despite being larger than a human and it likes to hide up in the trees.  From there it can ambush unsuspecting humans when they come close and the Serpent's venomous bite makes sure that anyone bitten will not survive for long.  The Serpent only hunts during the warm seasons.  When it gets cold, it becomes sluggish and only kills those stupid enough to walk straight into its mouth."

descr "Smartest of the smartest of beasts, that is, the Serpents, the Horned Serpent is distinguished by its sand-colored hide and the horns on its head. Since it is so smart, it is rarely found outside deserts, where it can burrow and hide beneath the sandy dunes only to spring forth and bite its meal to be. However smart the serpent is, it cannot hide its horns, and if you come across a sand dune sprouting horns you should probably walk the other way."

descr "Much smaller than the Serpent, the Snake is easy to hold at bay for an armed soldier.  However, it is important not to get bitten, because its poison is even more potent than that of the much larger serpent.  Despite its small size, the Snake is still cunning and dangerous.  Snakes often attack weakly guarded towns during the night when they can crawl over the walls unseen.  Once inside, they will try to bite a few humans to feast on after the luckier part of the town population has managed to escape."

Of course, its huge size makes it consume a massive amount of food, but the Elephant likes to show its friendly nature by moving around slowly and thus conserving its energy.  When hunting, the Elephant rushes forward at a surprisingly fast speed and tramples its prey to death properly before devouring it in a single bite."

If the queen is allowed to establish a new colony, armies of giant ants will start to appear soon afterwards and destroy everything nearby.

descr "Somewhat larger than a Fire Ant but still smaller than a Giant Ant, the Myrmeke can be called a ant of medium size. These ants are peculiar in their love of gold and other shiny things. As their home they have a large hill full with tunnels that are used to store both food and gold. They produce some of their gold by mining it, but most of it is acquired through raiding parties where they grab everything that is shiny or yellow and drag it back to their hill. During midday the Myrmeke are sleeping deep in their tunnels and during this time it is often possible for a fast person to grab some gold from the tunnel openings and make a run for it."

descr "Giant Ants can be a serious problem for people living in both villages and towns.  The thick armor on the ant makes it almost impossible to harm with normal bows and you need a large number of heavy crossbows to deal with one of these creatures.  City walls do not help either, because the Giant Ant does not seem to care if it is standing on flat ground or climbing a vertical wall.  The Giant Ant attacks by biting with its large mandibles or by spraying a potent acid on its victims.  Once inside a town, the Giant Ants will take as much food as they can and then wander off with it."

descr "Being smaller and less dangerous than a real Dragon, these much smaller flying beasts seem to have developed a very foul temper.  The Wyvern will fly around in the mountains and attack anyone that does not pose a threat to it, just because it can.  It is said to enjoy eating female Hoburghers most of all, so small people should be extra wary when traveling in the mountains.  Even though it is not a Dragon, the Wyvern is still dangerous, because it has a deadly poisonous stinger."

But by studying her behavior we can get a glimpse of her true nature.  She likes to build her nest in trees, she eats breadcrumbs when presented with the opportunity and she likes to sit in ponds.  This all proves that her true form is that of a giant bird, which would also explain why she can move so far without being seen running."

descr "This floating being is highly intelligent and likes to make its lair in ancient forests where the power lines flow strongly or in deep mines where there is plenty of gold and gems.  The Beholder often surrounds itself with enslaved guards from races stupid enough not to flee it in time.  Other than floating over power lines, it is believed that the Beholder likes gold much like Dragons.  Like Dragons, it also enjoys eating both Deer and Dwarves when it gets hungry.  In practice it is probably mostly Dwarves, because it will get less hungry when it is floating over the power lines in an ancient forest."

descr "This floating being is highly intelligent and likes to make its lair in ancient forests where the power lines flow strongly or in deep mines where there is plenty of gold and gems.

In practice it is probably mostly Dwarves, because it will get less hungry when it is floating over the power lines in an ancient forest."

 The druids claim that God of the Seasons is responsible for the turning of the year, which he obviously is not. This summer was just as long and hot as the previous one. One has to ask the druids, are your gods sleeping? If they haven't changed the order of the seasons for the last millennia, can they? Do they exist at all? Why worship that which is normal?"

 While the druids claim to be peaceful shepherds of wild animals, we can easily prove them wrong. Druids of deeper initiation tell of heathen gods, some drenched in the blood of war. While most druids gather and command animals, some have called beasts only heard of in legends to their side. This could implicate that the druids could actually summon the ancient giants they call gods. The one called God of War might be extra troubling, was he to actually be summoned to Elysium."

 The Goddess of the Sacred Spring would seem to be the most benevolent of the ancient titans worshipped by the druids, but let not appearances fool you. The heathen goddess arm herself not with conventional armaments, indeed she sheds her clothing, as if to take a bath, but with the weapons of a woman untamed. While the other heathen gods might be defeated by the arms of righteous, her presence would be a true test of our devotion. Burning her naked body on a stake, would truly be the magnificent end to the tyranny of the druid wild."

 The God of the Sea is perhaps the least dangerous of the heathen gods. The druids themselves claim that he sits in his halls in misty Mag Mell and rules over the sea. Since the druids see themselves as priests of the animals it might surprise you that they revere an ancient that claims dominion over the sea, but remember, even fish are animals, and druids can learn to swim even though they seem to reject the idea of a proper bath."

descr "The druid faith is indeed a strange heresy. They sequester themselves in the wild, feast upon honeyed beer and boar pork, dreaming up legends of huge golden boars, immortal so they can be eaten time and time again. So much do the druids and their boar warriors like pork that there have been literal wars over the right to hunt for the monstrous boars hiding in the deeper forests of Elysium. This propensity to hunt and eat boars has formed their simplistic beliefs rather than the other way around. Thus they fantasize about a great thrice-horned golden boar of exquisite flavor."

descr "Among the legends of primordial beasts told by the druids, none is stranger than that of the Rams-Headed Serpent. This beast, according to legend, was spawned when the worlds were young and Elysium was wild and inhabited by beasts. This statement alone arises suspicion. Elysium is demonstrably wild as it is, and beasts are plentiful. To imagine a time when things were actually worse does not lend credibility to the legend at hand.
The Rams-Headed Serpent supposedly guided the first men and taught them medicine. It is also regarded as a mediator between men and beasts. However, the beast has the head of a Ram, an animal known neither for its brightness nor its diplomatic skills, but rather for its tendency to butt gate posts, random trees and passers by with its forehead, so we must ask ourselves why this strange monstrosity has been given such reverence in the druidic faith. While we can trace the beliefs in the Thrice-Horned Boar to the druids' love for pork, there is no explanation for the beliefs surrounding the Rams-Headed Serpent. To a civilized mind it is just plain silly."

The triple-spirit supposedly protects the tribe and its lands from harm. Experiments have proven that this is false.

Trying to fight off a Giant Crab is usually pointless, because its very thick armor makes it very difficult to harm with normal weapons and the crab's claw is powerful enough to snap a human clean in two."

More than once an astrologer has been surprised to find a huge kraken climb his tower walls, drawn by the astrological experiments.  When the Kraken comes, it is important to have a magic trinket to throw away, because Krakens love magic trinkets and it should keep it occupied long enough to escape."

descr "The Giant Jellyfish are rarely seen by humans, because they usually float around in the deepest seas at the edges of the Void. They float around there because they like to eat Horrors and they are seemingly unaffected by the Void, probably due to their horrorlike appearance.  The Jellyfish should be seen as an important ally to humankind, because they help keep down the number of Horrors in the world.  Still, it is best to leave them alone as they are not very picky about what they eat."

descr "A huge Death Fungus growing on the grave of a loved one is seen as a good omen and means that the deceased one has gone to his final resting place.  The Death Fungus is one of the reasons you don't build a graveyard close to populated areas, because it spreads spores that are extremely deadly.  Anyone hit by the spores will start to wither and join the rest of the corpses in a matter of minutes.  The Death Fungus can spread very quickly once it has started to grow in a graveyard and it will quickly make the graveyard unusable for human beings.  The positive side is that the fungus will consume the corpses and make sure they cannot rise as undead."

The Blood Fungus shoots out a very large cloud of spores, but luckily these spores are not quite as poisonous as those that many of the other giant fungi produce.  Blood Fungi thrives in wet places and you should always be wary of them when traveling trough any bog."

descr "The strength of a cult almost always depends on having a good number of followers or cultists prepared to perform the necessary sacrifices to appease their gods or to do some dark deed or another.  The exception being of course the Cult of Ahala the Mad, which seems to thrive with just one unwilling follower at a time.  And may I never meet that one.  The Cultist of the Deep seems to be obsessed with blood sacrifices and the number three and they have an unnatural attraction to aquatic beings.  It is not advisable to buy romantic or erotic literature from cities that are permeated with these cultists, as I have been told that they can be highly unnerving.  Visits to their towns are not recommended either.  Though usually situated at scenic coastal locations, the unsuspecting traveler will often find himself strapped to an altar surrounded by Cultists in fish masks wielding obsidian daggers."

descr "Rumors from surviving travelers to remote coastal towns tell that there are some fish cultists who seem to be the result of crossbreeding between human women and some kind of fish creatures.  They receive traits from their aquatic fathers such as gills, scales or just being grey and slimy.  Though they have some innate magical abilities, they are often imbeciles and should not be asked for advice, because the answer will either involve more sacrifices or eating unhealthy amounts of shrimps.  Despite their lack of wits, the results of this planned breeding are considered to have high status and are readily taken into the fold of the cult.  If you encounter anyone remotely fishy in a coastal town, it is better to be safe than sorry.  There have been some problems for the workers at the manufactury where Mergus pickled cod tongues are produced."

descr "Though some of our scholars find it an interesting experiment in theory, the creation of new creatures through breeding rather than pure magic is considered cheating against the laws of magic according to Aegus in his Encyclopediae of Magic Theory.  By making an extract of male Angler fish and soaking female deep ones in it, one can get male angler fish to attach themselves to a Shambler, giving them the characteristic lantern of the angler fish.  From there it takes a minor magical manipulation to actually get the angler male to be completely absorbed by the Deep One and thus impregnating her."

descr "Though experiments with the hybridization of Deep Ones and angler fish has been banned all through the realm, some hideous samples of what must be failed experiments sometimes wash up on the seashore.  Dissection of the remains has revealed it to be the the result of an abhorrent coupling between a male angler fish and a female Shambler produces a far more powerful creature than either of its parents.  In theory such a creature would have the predator mind and lantern of its father and the sturdy body of a Shambler of its mother.  Let us all hope that those horrendous underwater experiments do not bear fruit."

According to a very fanciful and loosetongued sailor - who claimed he got his knowledge from a Mermaid he seduced – the temples of the depths are defended by heavily armored Shamblers who would happily kill and devour any intruder.  The sailor in question claims that he managed to steal a treasure from the temples by dressing up in the carapace of a Shambler and pretending to be a temple guard."

Crude imprints on sea shells and the occasional ravings of people who claim to have been abducted to the deep sea all give a picture of a huge Angler Spawn ruling the deepest ocean.  Between the frothing and the usual ravings about some “...stur”, the abductees who have been washed ashore mutter something about the queen sacrificing their minds to an Old One.  Disregarding such nonsense, researchers have managed to come to the conclusion that this elderly Angler Spawn must have absorbed many males, accumulating whatever esoteric power they may contain."

 None of our scouts or informants have been able to come with any firsthand information, but several have spoken to maddened fishermen who claim to have seen a terrible queen of the depth wearing a basalt crown in their dreams.
 In their dreams they are told to give their labor, thoughts and unspeakable acts as a tribute to their queen."

The king or so he is called, is the mightiest of all the male anglers, yet completely devoid of any urges beyond hunger, his mind is vacant and he is in every aspect, except when it comes to magical powers, impotent.
 His vacant mind makes him a great vessel for some being or entity from beyond the void. And he will become the eyes, body and voice for some strange creature from another world.
 Even when summoned by a cultist through many sacrifices, he will act erratic and eventually devour the cultist that fed him."

descr "One of the major drawbacks of living by the sea is the constant risk of being raided by Deep Ones, aquatic creatures with an interest in human flesh – both for gastronomic and carnal reasons.  Though they can be placated by sacrifices, they are too strange to rule in ordinary ways.  In attempts to preemptively eradicate their settlements, strange carvings of ancient gods have been found on cave walls and in coral reefs.  Some of their features seem to indicate that they are a form of slimy reptile,  but there is still an ongoing debate at the College as to how to classify them.  Though their head and extremities are in many ways similar to frogs and toads, the offspring that might be produced by breeding with humans, such as can be found in cultist infested villages, often sport many features from various sea creatures."

Luckily they do not appear to be too bright and have strange ways of moving sideways when attacking, which is why it is quite possible to outsmart what appears to be a superior force.  It has been argued that the Shambler shares some traits with crabs, lobsters and other shellfish.  Though their carapace is far softer, experiments with boiling Shamblers have revealed that they do indeed turn somewhat red when cooked."

On rare occasions the piles of sacrifices offered will arouse the interest of the mindless temple guardians of the Void - the Void Lord.  Terrible to behold and enraged to have been called forth from the Void, they will march out seeking new victims to sustain their unspeakable hunger.  Looking like nothing else in the realm, they can only be the creation of a mad god's twisted imagination. "

newmonster    "Master Illusionist"                                       #  740
descr "Having perfected the art of performing tricks with mirrors, the able Illusionist can call himself a Master Illusionist.  Having a somewhat loose definition of the truth, it is not a title that is acknowledged by any but the most weak-minded, and several charlatans lacking in ability have claimed this title based on nothing more than smooth words.  It is argued, and I would be prone to agree, that the art of Illusionism is a condition rather than an actual art.  In severe cases of mythomania, the victim spins lies so convincing that he can begin to create such false worlds in papers, in songs and finally in mirrors.  Such hallucinations sometimes spill over into our world, and the Illusionist, standing on the fence between madness and slyness can thus control his lies and hallucination.  Many wounded suitors have found that the person they lusted after was nothing more than just a wicked dream of an Illusionist.  Though I have by no means, regardless of any reputation in the college dorm, encountered such a creature myself, one can only imagine the pain the cruel Illusionist caused his victims as the object of their desire dissipated into thin air when they believed they had finally succeeded in winning the heart of their chosen love."

descr "The most untrustworthy of all the magicians in this realm, the Illusionist is a spinner of lies, a charlatan and a confidence artist caught in his own web of lies.  Aegeus has written in his ”Encyclopediae of Magic Theory” that Illusionism in no way fills the criteria of being a magical art, but should rather be seen as a form of advanced deception.  Though some have argued that the definition has to be broader than that of Aegeus, almost everyone has some experience with amateur tricks wrought by back room tricksters.  Who among you have not lost money on a card that you were certain had been played already, or come home with a shriveled pumpkin which was just a sorry reflection of the majestically plump specimen you bought at the market?  If that is considered magic, Elysium would soon overflow with second-rate magicians.  The best way to counter the Illusionists' mind tricks is to simply ignore and disbelieve anything they say or do."

descr "The only known feat of magic that the Illusionist can truly claim is the ability to conjure invisible eyes by which he can spy on the private lives of regular citizens, shying away from neither bedrooms nor privies.  In order to create such eyes, a mixture of soap and mercury is heated in a rune-covered retort until they are both vaporized.  The vapors are then carefully blown through a long silver straw until a bubble forms at the tip.  It is then left to dry in the reflection of the sun in 13 small concave silver mirrors. As the bubble is heated it will float upwards and out in the world."

descr "This feline creature may well be the ancestor of the regular Cat, which can at times randomly display a limited displacement ability when in confined spaces.  The Displacer Beast is far more deliberate in its actions, though still almost impossible to predict.  The cunning and conniving nature of most Illusionists makes them closely associated with this beast and may explain why they have succeeded in befriending the creature.  The Displacer Beast seems to originally come from a world where Cats and catlike creatures are treated with the utmost respect and it rewards any perceived harm to itself or its cousins with tentacled fury.  Anyone who has managed to make a Displacer Beast their pet can expect to find gifts of maimed and half-dead odd creatures from the Void at his doorstep or at the foot of his bed."

The Hounds appear to teleport, but this is only due to time flowing in another direction.

descr "Astronomers occasionally report how large stones from the stars descend upon us, causing harm, destruction and ill omens.  These celestial purgings are highly sought after, however, because they are rumored to be a strong magical conduit.  In rare cases these stones appear to have been hollowed out, containing the remains of a strange creature that seems to have died upon impact.  The tentacled creature looks like nothing else in the realm, but ancient texts talk about envoys from the stars serving a mad god from the Void.  However, this mode of traveling seem to indicate that they have been exiled rather than summoned.  Though none have been encountered alive, it has been speculated that should a starstone descend into the sea, the impact would be less grave, allowing for the odd creature to survive.  This would also explain the strange altars with crude images of tentacled humanoids found in the caves of the Deep Ones."

Though exiled, they still seem to serve and worship the mad writhing mass of the Void.

newmonster    "Daughter of Dvalin"                                       #  893
descr "It is a common misconception that the Dwarven society completely lacks women.  Some scholars have instead speculated that the female dwarf has characteristics that would make them indistinguishable from the Dwarven male.  However, the sudden expansion of their society has given us further insights into this peculiar people.  The Dwarves are in fact ruled by a matron, a Dvala, who seems to be the mother of all the Dwarves from a certain mine.  The College has obtained information revealing that the dwarves all stem from eggs laid by the Dvala.  The Dvala is courted by a handful of drones, a role that is considered the highest honor within the Dwarven society.  If a colony is successful, the queen will spawn a new queen who is ready to populate another mine."

newmonster    "Dwarf Worker"                                             #  894
descr "The newly hatched dwarf quickly takes on the role of a common worker.  At this stage they seem to be of a singular mind, mining away in the depths of the mountain.  Captured specimens have been duly dissected to reveal two vestigial limbs in the lower abdomen.  This has led Agathinus, our lead naturalist, to speculate that the Dwarves are nothing more than an advanced and adapted species of ant.  This view has been refuted some of our herbalists as outrageous.  They in turn claim that Dwarves are just intelligent mushrooms."

descr "Every so often there is a bad egg in the hatchery.  These Dwarves do not fit in with the rest and it is said that they lack the connection to the collective the rest of the Dwarves share, and it is often they who are responsible for the small private stashes that can be found hidden in and around mines.  Though a deviation from the general Dwarf, they have a vital role in dwarven society.  The regular Dwarf would be a poor scout or negotiator, so the Outdoor Dwarves are given the task of dealing with the outside world.  Many of us know the Dwarves to be greedy, nosy, untrustworthy and cruel, but this is most likely due to the fact that we only meet the Outdoor Dwarves, some that have even gone renegade.  While they are widely abhorred in their own society, Naso, our third biologist, claims that the Outdoor Dwarves are increasing in number and might become dominant in the future."

newmonster    "Dwarf Sapper"                                             #  902
descr "The simple minds of dwarves revolve around mining and digging and the prospect of never being allowed to dig again scares even the most battle hardened dwarf. This to the detriment of their army composition. It has been shown that an disproportionate number of dwarf soldiers have joined the dwarven sappers regiments. Strangely these sappers are armed with crossbows. While no sane commander would equip his crossbowmen with pick axes, the pick axe seems to give comfort to otherwise unruly dwarven crossbowmen stressed out by the fact that they are under fire."

newmonster    "Dwarf Commander"                                          #  903
descr "Every group needs a leader, and so also the Dwarven cohorts.  However, due to their collective nature, most Dwarves are bad leaders and the Outdoor Dwarves even worse despite being individualists.  In order to solve this problem, the Dwarves have come up with a unique method.  Each year three or more of the most loyal warriors are given an unhatched egg from a batch that is believed to become an Outdoor Dwarf, which he then has to eat.  Although a great delicacy, it is not advised to eat more than one.  If all goes well, the Dwarf will then have enough detachment from the collective to be able to lead a group effectively, but not so much that it would be rejected by the regular Dwarves."

descr "Among the highest ranked in the Dwarf society are the drones who do nothing but eat and mate with the queen.  The stern nature of most dwarves effectively hides that their greatest desire is to frolic about as drones.  A few illustrious drones gain access to not only the queen's body but her mind as well, and take their place as her councilors.  Whenever a new queen is hatched, it is the senior councilor's task to bring the egg to a new mountain.  It is believed that the councilors can communicate with their queen using only their minds and the sound of rocks."

descr "Every so often the Dwarven mines are beset by ogres, trolls and even giants.  As a last line of defense, there is a mixture of guards and arbalests lining the main chamber.  This is usually only a way to postpone the inevitable, should the giants have reached that far.  However, from time to time a lucky Dwarf might get a fortuitous shot against a giant's head, felling the foul beast.  Should this happen, the Dwarf is immediately taken away, given some privileges and training and set to man some of the ancient ballistas.  A Dwarven ballista need not hit the head in order to defeat a giant.  Despite being vital to the defense of the mines, some have been taken out from the mines in order to be used in sieges against our castles and cities."

Guarding the queen in almost impenetrable armor was a small but able host of guards.  After a long battle, they drove off the human attackers, which is why we had to resort to magic instead.  Later investigations revealed these guards to be in a position of honor among the Dwarves, appointed directly by the queen."

descr "Every so often the Dwarven mines are beset by ogres, trolls and even giants.  As a last line of defense, there is a mixture of guards and arbalests lining the main chamber.  This is usually only a way to postpone the inevitable, should the giants have reached that far.  However, from time to time a lucky Dwarf might get a fortuitous shot against a giant's head, felling the foul beast.  Should this happen, the Dwarf is immediately taken away, given some privileges and training and set to man some of the ancient ballistas.  A Dwarven ballista need not hit the head in order to defeat a giant.  Despite being vital to the defense of the mines, some have been taken out from the mines in order to be used in sieges against our castles and cities."

newmonster    "Troll King"                                               #  935
descr "Today most civilized people do not venture freely into forests or forested mountains.  Forests are treacherous places, dark, damp and filled with bugs and animals, and mountains are no better.  Worse yet are the Trolls that roam the forests and mountain slopes.  Though they are constantly kept at bay by our courageous armies, their brute strength and regenerative powers make them resemble an tenacious weed rather than a regular pest.  Surviving observers claim that the Trolls are led by a king and that in most Troll societies the king is the only male to survive the coming of age rituals.  Dissecting Trolls is a tricky endeavor, as any wounds or cuts tend to close again, and unless destroyed by fire or acid, it is more than likely that the Troll will revive on the dissecting table – which proved fatal to Lania the Anatomist.  Still, some of the dissections seem to indicate that the younger Trolls, which make up most of the fireball fodder in a Troll army, lack any gender.  This may confirm some stories that claim that the king will kill all other male Trolls and, if defeated, a new king will rise.  
 Mocking the regalia of our own nobility, the Troll King dons a crown, crudely hammered together from gold wares, and sits upon a stone throne using his gigantic club as a scepter when he is not out fighting battles.  As his great strength is only matched by his lack of sagacity, rulings by the Troll King are arbitrary at best, at least as long as his mother is not present.  Visitors are advised to bring gifts to the king, preferably fair princesses, but other valuable gifts may also suffice.  However, should you be in the position to need an audience with the Troll King, avoid bringing a live Goat as a gift, or at all, as this seems to throw the Troll King in to a fit of murderous rage."

descr "When the trolls grow older they grow bigger, meaner and more desolate.  At this stage the Trolls seem to prefer dark, damp spaces, mainly dark caverns, but they can also be found under bridges, in sewers and even the occasional cellar.  It is always advisable to avoid sending wanted children and pets into unknown basements by themselves.  The easiest way to draw out these pests – the Trolls - is through a well planned trail of gold.  Just make sure that there is a group of well armed adventures by the end of the trail, because leading a Troll into a neighbor's basement is in most civilized cities considered a capital offense.  The Troll can easily be found either by its smell, which can be described as fermenting rats, or by sound, which surprisingly enough is a rather pleasing baritone.  It has been speculated that there is a vague relation between Trolls and Sirens due to this.  But even if the Troll song is used to lure unsuspecting passersby, there is nothing in either physiognomy or internal organs that seem to indicate any kinship.  It is possible that it is the large cavities within the Troll's body that act as a sounding board, giving us an illusion of a good voice.  "

newmonster    "Forest Troll"                                             #  937
descr "Few good things have ever come out of the forests, and worst among the pests are the Forest Trolls.  Being present in most forests, they feed on unaware travelers and raid nearby farms - luckily they are not as powerful as many of their cousins.  According to most sources, they are considered the runt in the family and are often beaten by their stronger brethren.  Though they seem to be even more lacking in wits than any other Troll-kin - perhaps with the exception of Ettins, they somehow seem to have been gifted with a knack for cooking.  When not abducting humans, careful hunters have seen them gathering moss, crow eggs, purple berries and small rocks which everyone knows are used in their culinary practices.  At times Forest Trolls have been found chained to a cauldron in other Troll tribes.  It is said that some of the dishes prepared by a Forest Troll are highly sought after even among human gourmands.  However, such vile desires will of course only end in disaster, as was shown in the court of Baron von Helmstedt, who had captured a Forest Troll and added it to his kitchen staff in order to be able to serve such delicacies.  A scandal that involved a few missing children, some cracked teeth and a serious case of food poisoning at his mother's funeral proved him fatally wrong."

newmonster    "Rock Troll"                                               #  938
descr "Just as some Trolls reportedly mainly live in the forest, a somewhat stronger variety can be found near cliffs and in hilly terrain.  Though slower than the Forest Trolls, they tend to blend into the surrounding landscape and are thus almost impossible to detect until they stand over you, trying to rip off your limbs.  Standing prone for months on end, they often have moss or grass growing on them, hiding them even better.  Their rocky surface make them difficult to damage with swords or spears.  Clubs, pickaxes and even better, explosive magic, is to be preferred.  A very successful combination of ice and fire magic has been tested out on a captured Rock Troll in this College's very cellar.  Their regenerative abilities make them excellent test subjects, as they do not tend to die from one experiment to the next.  When making experiments on Trolls, one has to make sure to have a large enough pool of guards.  Further investigations have also revealed that these younger Trolls lack any gender, which seems to develop only at a later stage."

descr "Fighting Trolls is a difficult matter as they do not follow any basic rules of warfare.  However, there is one thing one should always keep in mind, and that is never to send any heroes to fight the Trolls.  In the Troll battles of Bingham Bridge, Theofrastus III sent in a group of well known heroes to the Troll King's lair in order quickly end the war.  At first it seemed a success, as the surviving heroes brought back the Troll King's still twitching arm as a trophy of their victory.  It has later been concluded that the following disaster was due to the Troll King's Mother entering the fray of the battle.  Although the female Trolls are less bellicose than the male Troll, they are very protective and maternal towards their offspring. "

descr "Few have met a female Troll and survived, because most such unfortunates will be devoured in one of many creative ways.  Though Troll cuisine can often be seen as rather simple, they appear to have a preference for human flesh, which they prepare in many ingenious ways.  Lady Eradeth of Bingham, who managed to flee after a three year long captivity, reported on how the lesser Forest Trolls go to great lengths to prepare puddings, pies, small fritters and other dishes out of human flesh.  Though she claims to not have tasted any of them, she did develop some unnatural cravings later in her life.  However, the culinary endeavors of the Ancient Troll are limited to crushing corpses with a mortar and pestle or throwing them whole into her large cauldron.  The secret of a good Troll mead are a few crushed farmers that go into the brew. "

newmonster    "Troll Shaman"                                             #  941
descr "During the first Troll Wars, the Troll Witch Doctors and Shamans caused some confusion among the civilized troops.  Although in appearance and action they appeared to be the feared female Trolls, upon closer inspection they turned out to be male.  It is uncertain if this was a response to the lack of female Trolls or a survival strategy for the males. 
 When the Trolls grow older, they will at some point be given their gender.  However, since there can only be one Troll King, the rest will either be eaten or if they for some reason, through age or pure luck are wittier they will take on a role that in many ways resemble that of the old female Troll.  This does not only limit itself to the use of magic but also the way they act and dress."

descr "At some stage the Troll Shamans are considered to be females by the rest of the tribe and given the same respect as the Troll Mother. In order to elevate themselves to Witch Doctors, the Troll Shamans will have to perform a ritual that includes self-castration.  In order for their parts not to grow back or reattach, they are ritually cooked and eaten by the Witch Doctor.  After this point they believe that their magic is concentrated and they can perform more intricate rituals.  Some human mages have tried to duplicate this ritual in order to concentrate their magic, but being based on superstition and unscientific measures, the only result was pain and ridicule."

descr "There have been observations on ancient shamans that are almost indistinguishable from the ancient Mother Troll, were it not for their tendency to talk to themselves or invisible creatures around them.  Some claim that they do indeed speak with the ancestral Trolls whose bodies have disintegrated through time, while others would more logically contend that the ancient shamans could be speaking with anything except a Goat and the Troll King would accept it as something to be revered.  whether it is age or a strange ritual that will give the elder shaman his power is unclear, though some claim that there is indeed a ritual in which the Troll King will confirm the gender role of the shaman, but it would not be advisable for the sake of either life or sanity to try to observe such a ritual."

descr "Though not really part of the Troll-kin, the Giants that survive into these days feel most closely aligned with the Trolls.  The Forest Giants are a bit more reclusive than their cousins, and spend most days wandering the forests longing for the ancient days when their ancestors ruled Elysium.  Though smaller than their cousins, they see themselves as the keepers of Giant memories.  However, just like most Giants and Trolls, their memory is somewhat lacking and their oratory skills leave something to be desired, which leaves their lore and sagas to be an ever shifting and jumbled mess.  The only thing that keeps them from being completely mutated is the rather long lives of most giants.  "

newmonster    "Hill Giant"                                               #  945
descr "The largest of giantkind see themselves as the Barons of the Troll realm.  They prefer to settle in old ruins and fortresses where they act like some kind of feudal lord, demanding food from the neighboring peasants.  To live in an area with a resident Hill Giant that is not taken care of by the local lord is in many places considered legal grounds for peasants to abandon their lands and not pay any taxes set by their regular lord.  Some particularly malicious farmers have seen this as an opportunity to access more lands as others move out.  Usually such an arrangement would have to include the delivery of human corpses, making so called Giant tenants particularly disliked.  Since the Hill Giants have a very high opinion of themselves, it makes them difficult allies for the Trolls and they have to be coerced with gold or promises of a greater castle in order to follow the armies and not go on private raiding sprees."

descr "It is easy to imagine that two brains would be smarter than one.  The case of the Ettin proves that notion wrong.  Troll-kin are not renowned for their intellectual capabilities and many stories tell us about how Trolls are easily fooled by quick-thinking pig herds or others that get a chance to pass them.  Ettins seem to be even worse off.  Magus Philosoficus Asina at our College launched the theory that most supernatural forces will redirect or reshape reality rather than create new things or forces.  As such, a supernatural creature with two heads will have half the mental ability of a creature with just one.  This claim was vehemently opposed by her colleague Ambustus.  In order to prove her point, Asina performed a ritual that split Ambustus into two smaller versions of him, and he, or rather, they, refuted the theory by creating a ball of fire that burnt Asina to a cinder. 
 When it comes to the Ettin, it does seem to have half the brain of an ordinary Troll and is easily fooled.  The origin of the Ettin is unknown, but some stories claim that it was originally a Giant who was given two equally convincing opposed views to ponder by a captured orator.  According to the same story, the Giant got a splitting headache that turned out to be quite literal."

descr "The smallest of the Giants lives in small tribes that often raid our farmlands.  Having had a close relationship with Trolls and Hill Giants, they have developed a dire craving for human flesh, but in being more cunning than their cousins, they often execute well planned raids on human villages or waylay travelers at crossroads in order to fill up their larders.  While Trolls seem to prefer females of noble blood, Ogres make no such distinction, and if anything they prefer a plump merchant to a skinny princess.  It is said that Ogres were originally a crossbreed between humans and giants, and while our anatomists claim that such a coupling would be impossible, the Ogres are more cunning than their brethren and sometimes an Ogre is born that looks almost human.  Another theory that has been recently investigated is that the Ogres were once a human tribe that has changed due to their proximity to Giants and the magical nature of their lands.  Regardless of their origin, travelers in the outskirts of the realm are well advised to avoid any offers from a large, oafish looking merchant or innkeeper to taste their confit de marchand."

descr "Lacking any lineage or any other civilized traits, while having weakness for gambling, the Ogre tribes have a rather unique way of choosing their leaders - they choose them by drawing lots.  The exact way that the lot is drawn changes from time to time as the current leader can choose if the lot or gamble will use dice, cards or just colored rocks.  Depending on the leader's choice, the process can take everything from a few minutes to several weeks.  Since the rules state that it has to be a gamble, the loser will be sacrificed to their gods, the exact way being chosen by a number die and can range from ritual dismemberment to being slowly crushed by rocks to being eaten by the tribe.  This mandatory gamble has led to the Ogres at times being led by the least worthy but most lucky member of the tribe.  Considering gambling a holy act, any human who wants to participate is allowed to do so, and throughout history there have been instances of notorious bandits leading Ogre tribes."

If food and plunder is to be had they will try to take it and if not they will try to burn everything down. Sometimes they get the order wrong and set things on fire before they have had a chance to plunder.
Some of the more clever of them have taken to wearing some kind of armor. Though a fearsome sight, the common goblin lack the wit to create a proper armor, so more often than not their armors consist of kitchen implements or similar trinkets. Many hoburg cake trays have been bent to fit a goblin as a breastplate."

descr "It should not come as a surprise that the puny goblins have managed to form a bond to wolves.
It is well known that goblins are close to dogs in both manner and physiology. They are cowardly unless in a group, their main concern are themselves and their bellies, and they tend to follow any authority. They are also not too picky with what they put in their mouth. Anyone has seen stray goblins at a market eating anything that falls to the ground.
Physically they share such traits as a powerful bite, with similar teeth, a tongue with which they can lick their nose or anything else they would need, and the same pointy ear. It has been suggested that goblins are just dogs that have been humanoidized by some wizard lacking both a sense of order and beauty."

descr "Deep beneath the roots of a linden tree one can sometimes find a small reptile, looking somewhere between a lizard and a snake. With their large eyes and their purr they have become a fashionable pet among  the rich and powerful. Just like a small dragon it will gather some coins and curl up on their minuscule hoard.
Lacking any other family they will be easily imprinted by the first humanoid feeding them some meat and gold. However one ought to be careful, as the linnorm will never stop growing, so fed enough meat and gold they will grow to an enormous size. As they grow their corruption grows, so your cute pet and guardian will grow to become your prisoner. Many a noble has been devoured by an overgrown linnorm when they no longer can feed it.
The only one known to have dominated a fully grown linnorm is the mother of the troll king. Possibly by poisoning it with a mushroom brew. If a troll keeps a Linnorm from when it is just a spawn, the diet of poisonous mushrooms will make both its breath venomous and its blood turn to poison."

descr "Being one of the largest creatures in Elysium, the trolls like everything large, from caves to partners to pets. The troll mother will seek out the largest of snakes to keep as pets. Though she will only seek them out one by one, and lure them by filling pits in the marches with a broth of mushrooms and dead humanoids, she seem to prefer to keep her Orms, as the large dragon-like snake is called, in pairs. This is possibly because trolls have simple minds and can neither devote enough time to develop a deep bond with just one pet, nor can they count beyond two, so pairs are easiest on their small minds.
The skin of the Orm is enough to dress a small army, so it is a coveted asset among commanders that want their soldiers to wear light but sturdy armors. For that reason it is popular among army commanders, even in peacetime,  to try to lure a troll mother and her pets into a trap. This will cost quite a few soldiers to the mercenaries hired but such is the fate of mercenaries. The exception being if one of the pets is a Linnorm, in which case the whole army is lost. "

descr "If you have been invited into the Pit of the Troll King, or more likely, being carried there in a bag, you might feel the very ground rumbling, as if something huge and ancient was snoring deep under ground. This is Gramps, the Ageless Troll, who has slept for centuries. Pray that he doesn't awaken.
His prodigious nose is the largest in all of the Trolldom, and it grows by every passing century. Since no one has dared to enter his moss-covered chamber to check on his nose, no one knows how large it really is. Trolls across the trolldom regularly pull their noses in hope of getting noses as long as Gramps'.
Gramps is the father of Mum and grandfather of the Troll King. He is older than any other troll, older even than magic itself, according to his daughter, and she should know. His powers are not bound by magic traditions such as troll magic and he reputedly just wills things, such as storms and earthquakes, to happen."

newmonster    "Elder Dragon"                                             #  963
descr "Dragons love gold and other shiny objects, just like Trolls.  They also share the same excellent sense of smell and seem to get along quite well together.  The only reason for two such seemingly different species to get along is because they share all other traits.  Thus we can also know that Dragons like princesses and have an irrational dislike for Goats.  To demonstrate this, a Dragon hatchling and a Goat were placed in the same room, each on its own pile of gold coins.  This resulted in the Goat charging the dragon in an attempt to take his gold and thus ruining the demonstration.  Note, never use Goats for demonstrations."

descr "Who has not seen the head of a dragon hanging above some two-penny count's hearth? The Fire Dragon is the dragon most often hunted by knights, and also the dragon that thrives best on mankind.
 The Fire Dragon is the most prolific of all dragons, and it may be that a nutritious diet of knights and the occasional kidnapped princess gives their hatchlings a good start in life.
 Though many knights are lured into hunting dragons by the promise of obtaining their immeasurable treasures, it is often a false quest. Some survivors have confessed that what they had believed to be gold was just the ember lights from the dragon's fire reflected on its red scales and their caves of red sandstone."

descr "In some of the deepest marshes, within clouds of dense miasma, dwells the Bile Dragon. It breathes poison and seems to thrive in the vile humors promoted in the swamps. It is uncertain what their immature form looks like, but in my opinion it is clear that the poison and miasma they exude indicates a twisted association to the element of earth.
 Some studies of defeated Bile Dragons have shown that they have wide cracks and large chafings in their otherwise thick and stone-like hide, and Basilea suggests in her Opus Draconica that the mud of the marshes may ease the itches the Bile Dragons suffer from, but that the vile humors of the swamp will seep into the cracks and be absorbed by the flesh beneath."

descr "Just like knights hunt the Fire Dragons in our part of the realm, barbarians in the northern wastes will try to hunt down their fabled Frost Dragons. In stark contrast to the Fire Dragon's diet of bold knights, the northern barbarians are less of a treat for the Frost Dragons. This is most likely due to their custom of smearing themselves with thick layers of rancid seal blubber to protect against the cold.
 The Frost Dragon’s lair is often found by observing a large amount of dead warriors frozen solid in various poses.
 According to Meena, the barbarian dragon slayer, the way to defeat a dragon is to 'hit it and then hit it again...oh and not to freeze'. It is probably helpful that her cousin is the inventor Lucius, of the fabled anti-freeze potions."

While the rest of dragon kind is too cumbersome to travel the clouds without falling through, the Storm Dragon hunts and nests there with ease. It is reported that their nests are made up with feathers from cloud people, so it is assumed that they are also their preferred prey. Some attempts have been made to ascertain the diet of the Storm Dragons, but so far the Cloud Lords have refused whatever reasonable requests to borrow some of his subjects to try out the theory. He even refuses to tell us how many from his realm have been taken by dragons."

newmonster    "Fire Dragon Hatchling"                                    #  969
descr "Newly hatched dragons look just like their older brethren, just smaller, and during their first few months their scales are still soft as leather and their flesh is very tender. Many cultures consider the Dragon Hatchlings a delicacy, so both eggs and hatchlings are frequently hunted. In the western provinces, the hatchlings are gutted, pickled in honey vinegar and spices and then spit roasted and covered in sesame seeds. For a Fire Dragon hatchling the spices need to be light, as the meat in itself is dominated by heat. In the north the hatchlings are instead pickled for several weeks in whey and sour milk, and then cooked in the ground while stuffed with onions and leeks.
 Dwarves, being dwarves, do not understand the concept of a delicacy, so they just dry the hatchlings, grind them and then cook them into a porridge or slush together with ground-up roots and mushrooms."

descr "Oldest among a race of ancient beings, the King of the Deep is prophesied to lead the Pale Ones in conquest of Elysium, and die a martyr's death in the process.
 We have been told by the Dwarves that the lore concerning the future of the Pale Ones is limited, but it would seem that the Pale Ones themselves put a lot of trust in foretellings and readings of fate.  This should be expected from a race with a lengthy lifespan and slow wits.  The King of the Deep was until recently just a myth, but some time ago one of our mines was attacked by an army of Pale Ones led by a tremendously large, bronze-armored giant.  The Pale Ones were thought to be peaceful, albeit protective of their homes, like badgers, but this new development indicates that there is a new will stirring in the halls of the deeper earth.  If it is the emergence of the King or if some even more sinister power is at work we do not know.  One way or another, the King must be linked to the recent aggression of the Pale Ones."

descr "Much like apes have devolved from humans, scholars have claimed that the Pale Ones are degenerate Olms.  The proud Olmic race lives in dark caverns under the Roots of the Earth.  While Olms are blind, they are gifted with superior minds and the ability to sense their surroundings as well as the minds of others.  How the Pale Ones devolved from the Olms is not known, but closeness to the surface world and the influence of foul magic seems likely.  The Pale Ones are a strange race of one-eyed humanoid Olms.  Grossly fat, one-eyed and bereft of deeper intellect, it is clear they were not meant to be.  Untouched by the sun, they have become known to us as the Pale Ones.  They are gifted with perfect darkvision and gills, but their single eye is inferior to even the eyes of fish.  The Pale Ones, like their Olm ancestors, inhabit underwater rivers and lakes as well as cavern halls."

descr "The Pale Ones have only a rudimentary understanding of warcraft, but even their slow and simple minds have come to grasp the usefulness of ranged attacks. Most Pale Ones throw rocks upon their opponent before engaging them in melee, but we have recently seen examples of military advancements among the cave dwellers. Slings made from cave cow leather seem to be increasingly common in the armies brought to the surface by the Pale One leaders. While not nearly as effective as the bows or crossbows used by civilized men, they represent a new level of intelligence never before displayed by the cavernous brutes. It is quite possible that the entire race have come under the influence of an unscrupulous human who uses them to his own ends."

How the Pale One scouts manage to perform their task is still a mystery, considering the limits of their one eye.  There are indications that some spark of the Olmic mind still resides in the brains of the Pale Ones.  If so, it is possible that the Pale One scouts are gifted individuals with abilities to sense minds in their vicinity.  However, it is more likely that they use their affinity for slow movements in the dark to avoid detection while observing enemies with their big black eye."

descr "The Cavern Guards are the elites of the Pale Ones.  Their armor is heavier and they use long bronze glaives that can strike with surprising effect.  The Cavern Guards had previously never been encountered, except in dwarven accounts, but with the recent attack on a remote iron mine there was a large contingent of glaive-wielding guards that prevented our forces from entering the mine while some strange ritual was performed in the depths.  When the Cavern Guards finally retreated there was a rumbling in the mountain and most of our army was buried in an avalanche.  While most would assume that the Pale Ones do not have the mental faculties to form social groups and hierarchies, the presence of the Cavern Guards clearly show that even a backward race of grub-men will evolve if exposed to the culture of other races."

descr "The Pale Ones seem to have a rudimentary understanding of hierarchy, apart from the instinctive animal behavior to follow the largest member of the pack.  Some Pale Ones are armed with weapons made of iron, but their equipment is otherwise similar to the bronze armaments of the Pale One soldiers.  This has several implications.  First, that they have managed to trade and communicate with other races, most likely dwarves.  Secondly, they have learned the arts of ironworking.  This changes in many ways how we look upon the slow-witted Pale Ones.  The use of iron and the implications of hierarchical order are also far beyond earlier preconceptions of the Pale Ones' capabilities.  The Pale Ones clearly follow their iron-clad commanders.  It is possible that these commanders are gifted with a shard of Olmic legacy, but there are some scholars who actually ascribe all Pale Ones a working, albeit inferior, mind."

descr "The recent encounters with the Ancient Pale Ones have given us much more understanding on their culture and society.  Early encounters with the race have been with scouts and young ones.  The older the Pale Ones get, the larger they grow, and the more influence they wield.  It is probable, but not certain, that their minds and cunning also grow with age, but the presence of young commanders and magically skilled Earth Readers suggest that most of the Pale Ones are born stupid and never develop higher mental faculties, while a few are born with the skills to lead or learn magic.  When such individuals grow old they will invariably become leaders of their brethren."

descr "The Pale Ones have very long lifespans.  The one captured and held locked up in the dungeon of sir Boyd the Second survived for three generations, despite rough treatment.  It was put to display at the yearly summer festival by the Boyds.  By the time Castle Boyd was destroyed by the foul magics of Ephagina, the beast was so large it could barely be pushed out of its cell.  There are reports of other overgrown Pale Ones, and it is likely that they can survive and grow to become giants if left alone in the deep caverns of the world.  While the captive beast was blind and grossly fat, it is likely that an Ancient Pale One living in its natural habitat would be both strong and clever."

descr "Somewhere in the deeper reaches of the earth there is rumored to be a sealed chamber.  Dwarven lore on the matter is limited, but more comprehensive than the few tidbits gathered from explorers, goblins and captured Pale Ones.  It is clear that some of the Ancient Pale Ones are given exceptional training and weapons made from enchanted obsidian.  The Dwarves claim that they are called Seal Guards by the Pale Ones and that most of them leave their home and wander to the deepest reaches of the earth on a holy quest when their training is done.  We have only encountered a few of these armored giants, and we have never captured one alive, so the mysteries remain.  The recent addition of a thought-reader to the Royal Inquisitive Order is supposed to bring clarity to the matter.  Unfortunately it would seem the thought-reader was read himself, while questioning an Olm prisoner.
 What is known of the Seal Guard is that they are supposed to guard the Sealed Chamber with enchanted weapons to prevent 'corrupted souls' from spreading.  What 'corrupted souls' means we can only speculate."

descr "The Earth Readers are the religious leaders of the Pale Ones.  They are the keepers of Pale One traditions and even the Ancient Ones seem to follow their advice.  The lack of culture and religious understanding previously attributed to the Pale Ones has not taken the Earth Readers into account.  The existence of the Earth Readers shows that the Pale Ones have formed a hierarchical society based not only on physical strength, but on control of beliefs and tradition.  The Earth Readers have unearthed magical lore and according to some sources they may even surpass dwarven understanding of magic, although that is more or less damning with faint praise.  If there are ancient Pale Ones grown to huge proportions, one might speculate on the possibility that there are ancient Earth Readers that have likewise grown in size and magical power."

descr "The Earth Minds are Earth Readers of exceptional skill.  Surpassing the dwarven rune-smiths in magical power, they indicate that there are far greater powers in the deeper earth than we had previously thought.  Considering the gemstone riches of the Pale Ones encountered so far, we can only come to the conclusion that the deeper earth holds vast treasures ready to be plucked.  The Earth Mind may get his name from his ability to instill false life in the statues and sentinels littering the cavernous halls of the Pale Ones.  Or it may be the honorary title of someone who actually can use his mind."

newmonster    "Troglodyte"                                               #  989
descr "Troglodytes are large cavern-dwelling beasts rarely found on the surface world.  They have their mouth and some bright green organs thought to be their eyes in the middle of their chest.  Troglodytes have strangely rat-like tails and fur.  Some scholars claim that they are in fact corrupted and overgrown rats.  If so, there may be a powerful corrupting force in the deeper caverns of the world.  The preferred food of Troglodytes is not known, but they do welcome the occasional human as a snack.  Troglodytes have been encountered in the armies of the Pale Ones and it is likely that they breed the Troglodytes like dogs of war."

newmonster    "Penumbral"                                                #  990
descr "Shades and ghosts are what remains of a person when the body has died and they are thought to be the spirit or soul of the person.  Some scholars argue that they are just manifest memories, but that can be easily refuted by anyone with a brief understanding of Hades.  The Pale Ones are considered to be dumb brutes with mental faculties barely exceeding those of common beasts.  While this might appear to be the case if you try to communicate with them in your own language, it is quite clear that they do indeed have a mind and a soul, albeit inferior to ours.  The Penumbrals are shadowy beings resembling Pale Ones, but their lower soul is manifest and their faces are distorted and prolonged into sucking mouths that feed on the lifeforce of living beings. These strange shades have been encountered in Pale One armies which suggests that the Pale Ones have mastered not only Geomantic spells, but also the dark arts of Necromancy."

descr "The Pale Ones seem to be accomplished Necromancers as well as masters of elemental magic.  The dark spirits of the ancient dead have been encountered on several occasions.  Worst of these abominations are the Umbrals, huge spectres resembling Ancient Pale Ones with prolonged faces ending in sucking mouths.  It is not known if the spirits of dead Pale Ones grow like the living ones, or if the larger Umbrals are the spirits or memories of ancient ones.  To date there are no records of magically adept Umbrals, so there might be some truth to the Dwarven claims that only weak souls that are easily corrupted return as Umbrals.  Dwarven lore also suggests that there is a Cavern of Deeper Shadow somewhere, a dread place where Umbrals reign."

descr "The caverns of the Pale Ones are littered with statues and sculptures.  Every passage is guarded by silent watchers staring at intruders with a stony cyclops eye.  Only surprise and shock can describe the reactions of the first explorers to encounter the living Sentinels of the deeper earth.  It is still not known how the dim-witted Pale Ones have managed the magical feat of reanimating the Sentinels.  Theories range from necromantic possession to pacts with elemental beings.  Most of these theories assume that the Pale Ones themselves are not capable of giving the Sentinels life.  This position is flawed and may prove disastrous in the future.  Recently a castle at our borders was retaken from the Pale Ones.  The gates were defended by living statues almost impervious to our swords, but fortunately the Pale Ones were unable to field missile troops, and eventually the statues were smashed and the castle was liberated."

newmonster    "Granite Guardian"                                         #  993
descr "While untrustworthy reports have claimed that the very statues of the Pale Ones are alive, we had never considered the possibility that the Pale Ones could reanimate statues the size of giants.  When the Dwarves found a new colony, they raise walls and build sturdy gates to protect their home.  The Pale Ones are less industrious, but they boast magical powers surpassing dwarven skills.  In several mines recently wrested from the Pale Ones, statues of huge Pale Ones walking side by side with their living models wreaked havoc on our soldiers.  Fortunately the Granite Guardians seem reluctant to leave their posts, so a full scale invasion of living stone giants is unlikely."

That the statue moved and fought was a bit shocking to our troops, but more so was the fact that the abomination used magic to defend its living kin.  Dwarven reports are now revisited and tales of lumbering stone oracles leading the Pale Ones in prayer might give us new insights into the cultic practices of the Pale Ones.  Presumably the Marble Oracles are reanimated by the memories of their former selves, but this possibility will remain unconfirmed until a specimen has been captured.  Other suggestions regarding the magic skills of the statues include necromantic possession and sealed enchantments."

descr "The Pale Ones have long lifespans and they seem to fear and marvel at the concept of death.  Their dead ones are entombed in great halls and statues are made in their image.  The souls of their dead are not as advanced as human souls and therefore do not enter Hades.  Instead the memories and spirits of their dead remain in their mummified bodies.  It was recently discovered that these mummies are reanimated through necromantic rituals.  Since the souls of the dead remain in their mummified bodies, the revenants retain memory and purpose and are considered part of the Pale One society.  It is even likely that the Cavern Wight gets more respect and status than its living kin."

descr "According to Dwarven lore, there is a sealed chamber somewhere in the deeper reaches of the earth.  It is supposed to be guarded by Ancient Pale Ones armed with glaives with obsidian heads.  During our recent excavation of a sealed cave we found a vast tomb filled with statues and mummified corpses of Pale Ones of different sizes.  In the deepest part of the tomb was an area where huge mummified Pale Ones in bronze armor and carrying obsidian glaives laid staring at the ceiling above.  With the newly gained insight that the Pale Ones practice Necromancy, it is not unlikely that the mummified corpses of these giants are also reanimated.  If so, they must have superior knowledge of the deeper earth and should be captured and interrogated by a loyal Necromancer who is able to communicate with the dead.

descr "When the seal to the third tomb was broken it was clear that it was something special.  The walls and pillars were adorned with gemstones, crystals and rare metals.  Life-like statues and mummified corpses littered the place.  In an inner chamber there were thrones of onyx and lapis lazuli on which sat mummies of bloated Pale Ones draped in jewelry.  We have heard rumors of Oracles of the Deep, ancient Earth Readers with great powers.  Now we can be certain that at least in earlier times there were such ancient Oracles.  The discovery is worrisome.  Its implications are that the legendary Oracles do exist and are possibly still present in the deeper reaches of the earth.  It might also mean that necromantic arts can be used to reanimate these entombed oracles and tap their ancient knowledge and power.  To prevent any unforeseen events we quickly disposed of the mummified giants we found with fire and vitriol."

descr "Olms are an ancient race of wormlike beings gifted with superior intelligence and a mind that extends beyond its body, according to Pyrrho.  The Olms have lived in the water-filled caverns of the deeper earth since the dawn of time.  They are a proud race with an incomparable history.  Since every Olm can sense and partake in the mind of the Conclave, the social grouping of the Olms, their history is never forgotten and grows with every meeting of two conclaves.  However, regardless of the vastness of their history, we imagine that it would easily fit in a short book or two.  The Olms have never left the underearth and most of their history would probably be recordings of the frequency of dripping water in their dismal caverns.  An interesting fact regarding the Olmic race, apart from their long history, is that the Olms are considered to be the forefathers of the Pale Ones.  Since we don't have access to the historical records of the Olmic Conclaves, we cannot be sure of this.  Troglofilus tried to dissect a number of Olms to see if it was possible to map their history through their brains, and thereby prove that the Pale Ones have nothing in common with the Olms.  His experiments failed, but he did prove that the red feather-like appendages surrounding the neck of the Olms are not external brains, but gills."

descr "The ancestry of the Pale Ones is much disputed. Either they are devolved Olms, or evolved Cave Grubs.  Those of us who believe that the Pale Ones are conscious and have a will would place them in the first category.  Cave Grubs resemble the grubs found in dirt and dung all over Elysium, only bigger.  Grubs have a multitude of small feet, but no apparent prehensile appendages.  Olms on the other hand have four prehensile limbs.  Pale Ones resemble humans, in that they have arms with hands and legs with feet.  They are clearly closer to Olms than grubs in this regard.  Furthermore, Cave Grubs produce a highly corrosive saliva, which again do neither Olms, nor Pale Ones.  It should be noted that the Pale Ones herd the beasts and use them as tunnelers and excavators of their deep-earth kingdoms.  Finally, the grub is blind and orients itself through unknown means.  The Olm is also blind, but some organs resembling eyes can be found on the sides of their heads.  Pale Ones are cyclopean, but a change from two eyes to one is less far fetched than getting a new one where there was none.  So we must conclude that the Pale Ones truly are a species of degenerate Olms."

descr "Cave Cows are strange beings of the deeper earth that feed on fungi and minerals.  Its saliva is highly corrosive and can dissolve rock and minerals.  While most scholars adhere to either the Olm theory or the Grub theory, Troglofilius suggested that the Pale Ones were created together with the Cave Cows, and did not evolve from Olms nor Grubs.  This would suggest a mad creator god and Troglofilius' theories are refuted by most sane scholars.  To prove his theory right, the late scholar embarked upon an expedition through the lands of the Pale Ones.  According to the only survivor of the expedition, Troglofilius died when an annoyed Cave Cow spit him in the face as the scholar tried to collect samples from the specimen."

newmonster    "Penumbral"                                                # 1007
descr "Shades and ghosts are what remains of a person when the body has died and they are thought to be the spirit or soul of the person.  Some scholars argue that they are just manifest memories, but that can be easily refuted by anyone with a brief understanding of Hades.  The Pale Ones are considered to be dumb brutes with mental faculties barely exceeding those of common beasts.  While this might appear to be the case if you try to communicate with them in your own language, it is quite clear that they do indeed have a mind and a soul, albeit inferior to ours.  The Penumbrals are shadowy beings resembling Pale Ones, but their lower soul is manifest and their faces are distorted and prolonged into sucking mouths that feed on the lifeforce of living beings. These strange shades have been encountered in Pale One armies which suggests that the Pale Ones have mastered not only Geomantic spells, but also the dark arts of Necromancy."

descr "In ancient times there was a war among gods.  When the false gods and their pantheons were defeated, the winning God bound them in the only vessels capable of holding god-spirits, the bodies of dead Titans.  The Titan bodies were entombed at the Roots of the Earth and the tomb was sealed with the aid of a young and innocent race with pure souls, the Pale Ones.  With their sacrifice, the prison was eternally sealed and peace returned to the world.  The few remaining Pale Ones were given the task of guarding the Chamber of the Seal and they have kept vigil ever since.  Now the Seal is broken and the Imprisoned Ones have returned, bound to the flesh of the God Vessels.  The God Vessel is tremendously powerful and will wreak havoc on the world unless destroyed or imprisoned once more."

descr "In ancient times a power hungry God bound entire pantheons of gods in the bodies of three dead Titans.  Each of the three God Vessels contains a legion of imprisoned gods merged together into an entity of vast power.  When the Seal was broken, the God Vessels returned to the world to wreak havoc, but the Legion of Gods was still bound in the flesh of a dead Titan.  When the God Vessel was destroyed, the entire pantheon of mad gods emerged with unfettered powers, leaving destruction, madness and grief in their wake.  Hopefully the entity will leave Elysium for other planes of existence."

descr "The Kappa is a scaled humanoid with a turtle shell on its back.  It is a water-being and haunts rivers and wild coasts.  The Kappa has a water filled depression on the top of its head and if this water is spilled, it loses its strength.  More than all other food, the Kappa loves cucumbers.  If it had enough cucumbers, it would just sit and munch on them and never leave its pond.  Sometimes a clever Kappa takes up residence in a ford and demands cucumbers to allow travelers to cross.  In addition to being a great cucumber eater, the Kappa is also a master of koppo, the bone-breaking technique."

Only dragons and beasts of similar ferocity stand a chance against the Omukade, and not even dragons are sure to survive its venom. It is claimed that human saliva is as poisonous to the Omukade as its venom is to humans, a claim that has repetitiously been proven false by self proclaimed heroes."

descr "The Tatsu is a serpentine dragon with the golden scales of a carp, the head of a camel, the horns of a deer and the claws of a tiger. It is surely as ugly as any monstrosity that serves the Bakemono Kings. The Tatsu seems to be adept in elemental magic, and it can fly through the sky, despite missing wings. It has been suggested that it is their pearl that gives them the ability to fly, but it is more likely that it is their carp scale skin that enables flight. To date no Tatsu has been willing to mould its skin for our sages to inspect, and the Dragon Hunt of last summer was remarkably unsuccessful, with the leader of the expedition being struck by lightning before the alleged mountain abode of the Tatsu was even reached."

newmonster    "Burgmeister"                                              # 1065
descr "The Hoburghers are generally considered jovial, friendly and industrious but somewhat naïve.  According to Bibula the Nauseated, this view is completely wrong.  Her close study of the Hoburg society presents them as driven by greed and hunger, with a slight contempt for the rest of the world.  Although originally an agricultural society, they have recently transitioned to an urban society with a focus on refining their produce and manufactured goods.  Their lack of understanding of any higher form of magic has led them to tinker with cogs and wheels.  At first glance the Hoburg village may appear peaceful, picturesque and welcoming, but Bibula concludes that one need only spend a few hours there to realize that everything is too small except the meals, which are instead overdimensioned, sickly sweet and far too greasy.  On anything but the windiest of days, soon a thick smog will settle over the Hoburg villages and towns.  The Hoburghers also have the strangest fashion of choosing their leader.  Instead of basing it on birthright or divine favor as any civilized nation would, or on contest as in the barbaric countries, the Hoburghers instead elect their leaders based on who is the wealthiest among them."

descr "Since the Hoburghers are being plagued by a constant cough due to the heavy smog that has settled over their villages of late, the Horticulturist and the herbs he can provide to relieve such conditions are highly valued.  The Horticulturist also plays a vital role in providing the society with various herbs for flavor, pleasure or political schemes.  Because the Hoburghers are obsessed with food and drink, such herbs are widely sought after, and lucky is the brewer who can get a hold of the secret herb mixture or fruit of a Hoburgher Horticulturist.  Though Hoburg beer is widely popular and carries a high price across the world, there are some who think that the herbs in the beer are highly addictive and as such are the main weapon of the Hoburg nation.  It is rumored that at times the Horticulturist will visit lonely but fertile farms with a special brew.  Soon after the inhabitants are addicted to the drink and are easily moved out from the farm, and not long after a thriving Hoburg village will spring up."

descr "Tending the Burgmeister's gardens is the Garden Master, a Horticulturist who has dedicated his or her life to the study of the intricacies of plantlife in further detail.  While maintaining a beautiful garden, the Garden Master will also introduce strange and exotic plants in the Garden to study the ways they can be used.  It is well known that they still maintain the ancient ritual of calling the Forest Guardians, strong treelike creatures, to the defense of the Hoburg villages, should an overwhelming danger arise.  This bond with the forest stems from an ancient time when the Hoburghers were more in tune with the Nature around them.  At times the Garden Masters will travel the known world's colleges and universities in pursuit of more knowledge.  From various forgotten or recently discovered notebooks it has been possible to discern a peculiar interest in fertilization.  Though our scholars have had no opportunity to sample the soil there, Bibula has put forth the theory that the Hoburg heartlands are all worn out due to the high yields that have been demanded from the soil there, and the foul remains pouring out from the new manufacturies."

descr "In the words of Metucullus the Chronomancer, “the foundation of any good business is to control time”.  Though his practice of manipulating the horse market through time travel is generally frowned upon, it still rings true for most manufacturers.  This rings even more true in the Hoburg manufacturies where the many food related pauses could bring any production to a halt should the pauses be uncontrolled.  Trying to solve this problem in various ways, now most manufacturers have chosen to employ the powers of the Horologist, filling their workspace with clocks and watches.  The knowledge of cogs, wheels and springs also make them apt at improving the various equipment at the facilities.  It is said that the whole industrial eruption was started by Konradin the Gilded, a Horologist who constructed the “Churning Esmeralda”, a machine that could produce large amounts of butter in no time."

descr "Taking the craft of the Horologist to another level is the Clockwork Master Crafter.  Though there are crafters and clockmakers elsewhere who have produced exquisite clockwork musicians or chess players, most have just seen it as a form of entertainment with no further consequence.  Among the Hoburghers, however, the clockwork worker was a way of expanding their manufacturies when there was a lack of workers.  Though mainly confined to their manufacturies, some rumors claim that the increasingly aggressive Hoburghers now employ Clockwork Soldiers in their armies.  Though not officially acknowledged, it came under suspicion as a group of Hoburgher fighters were never seen eating during a siege in Lower Ferovia, and it was somewhat confirmed as the same troops continued fighting even after literally losing their heads."

descr "To gather any larger group of Hoburghers can often prove to be an insurmountable task, something that can be seen in the traditional Hoburg defense force, the militia.  The militia consists of the free Hoburghers gathering every Sunday to parade with crude metal helmets and eat fruitcake.  The militia is usually a sorry sight and do not provide much is terms of fighting power.  Being badly armed and small in stature, they offer no real resistance.  It is often assumed that the compact stature of the Hoburghers originates from their close affinity with the earth that they traditionally toil, as it tries to pull them back down.  However, some studies of their earlier history have revealed partial evidence that they originally lived in burrows, living off of worms and dead animals.  It is possible that their great appetite stems from this earlier constant hunger."

descr "As the Hoburg nation is getting more and more organized, so is their army.  Better armed and more organized than the militia, the soldiers provide more of a fight but is a nightmare to lead due to the logistics problems associated with any Hoburg army.  Not only are they dependent on the constant replenishment of their supplies, but the army will move painfully slow over any terrain.  It is often believed to be due to their small stature and short legs, but that notion has often been proved wrong when encountering Hoburghers in a fight.  A more likely reason for the slow pace is the many food stops.  On any given day the average Hoburgher will eat six meals, not counting snacks or informal get-togethers, or food eaten on the go.  There are many theories about the reason for the constant hunger of the Hoburgher, and some failed attempts at curing them.  Some believe it to be due to the magic deficiency present in many Hoburghers, a deficiency said to originate from an small portal inside them through which both food and magic are drained to another plane of existence.  This is of course nonsense and many learned scholars of today have concluded that they must be inhabited by a small daemonic parasite, much like the more mundane parasites that can be found in various cattle."

descr "Among the more prominent Hoburg citizens a popular sport is wyvern shooting.  Though it is said to be a tradition that originated with an actual wyvern attack on Kuchendorf some forty years ago, today it only consists of a small silver wyvern on a high pole, which the Hoburghers take turns to try to shoot down.  The winner is given a wyvern medallion that is worn to impress their neighbors.  Some of these wyvern shoot winners form the core of the crossbowmen in the Hoburg army."

descr "For many years the Hoburg army was easy prey to any heavy cavalry, especially the heavily armored knights.  However, using their cunning, technical aptitude and general fear of being killed, they soon came up with a plot to fight their mounted foes.  By combining long pikes with the firm foundation provided with a low center of mass and large feet, they were able to stop even the most well armored cavalry."

descr "In the great Hoburg hall the Burgmeister is protected by a selected elite of Hoburg Defenders.  This guard will follow the Burgmeister everywhere he goes, offering protection with their lives and armor.  Some people have complained that the Guard provides the Burgmeister with undue business advantages, as they are not shy of using power to enforce deals.  Such complaints seem to have a tendency to go away after being uttered once.  Unique among the Hoburg troops is a clause in their contract which says that the Burgmeister Guard may never go hungry.  The costs of the Guard are currently half of the budget for the whole army.  The Burgmeister Guard can be recognized by their gaudy red berets, golden breastplates and fancy pants made of several different fabrics."

descr "Where other nations consider the horse the foremost of animals, the Hoburghers are most closely associated with the swine.  The prized hogs are more than just a favorite food.  In many Hoburg towns one should not be surprised to see a family outing with a hog on a leash accompanying them and participating in the traditional pie eating.  A matter of pride for many Hoburg farmers is the yearly “fattening the hog” competition, in which the farmers with the fattest pigs of different ages win recognition and a fine trophy.  From Schmalzburg comes the sow butter, which is widely acclaimed among Hoburghers.  During the Troll Wars some of the richest pig-farmers gathered together and set up a well armed unit that rode on a particularly fierce breed of hogs.  The hog used for this unit is usually co-bred with wild boars in order to provide a gamier taste to the Dark Forest smoked ham.  Though expensive, the peppery sweetness of the well larded ham is not something one ought to miss out on."

newmonster    "Hoburg Scout"                                             # 1080
descr "It is well known that Hoburghers are like sheep; and prefer to eat, travel and fight in large flocks. The similarities doesn't end there however. Like sheep they scare easily, especially if alone. Thus there are very few scouts defending the hoburg armies from ambushes and bandits. Instead the Hoburghers rely on their numbers and seek comfort and safety from their flock. This has made Hoburghers popular targets by clever bandits who take advantage of their sheep-like mindset and scare them into forming tight groups of frightened Hoburghers unable to efficiently defending themselves."

In order to make the display a bit more lively, the mechanical soldier was adorned with a small ruby imbued with fire.  Though this resulted in the belfry being burnt to the ground, the Burgmeister could see the strategic implications of the clockwork constructs and ordered the Horologist to make more."

newmonster    "Sapphire Clockwork Soldier"                               # 1082
descr "It is quite easy to notice if an approaching Hoburg army contains a Horologist due to the clanking sound of his many Clockwork Soldiers.  Though clunky and erratic, they make a very good addition to the army as they can man the first line of battle while the Hoburghers finish their pie and beer snack. 
The constructs are all powered by a large mainspring and a jewel imbued with a certain element.  Before battle all constructs have to be wound up and the jewels have to placed in the right place, which is why it is preferable to attack the Hoburg forces by surprise.  As everyone knows, the sapphire is connected with the Plane of Water and, when used in a construct, it will shoot forth a jet of ice cold water that paralyzes the victim.
 Being a superstitious lot, the different Barbarians fear the constructs in the Hoburg armies and will likely break if they meet a large group of constructs.  During their wars against the Barbarians, the small unwalled village Kopfdorf faced almost certain destruction at the hands of a Barbarian raiding party.  While the village elders despaired and tried to find ways to escape, the apprentices of the local workshops together with some farmhands dressed up in discarded bits of clockwork constructs because they could find no armor and moved outside the village to make a desperate last stand.  The Barbarians saw the strange and unbendy movement of the metal figures, and assuming that it was an army of constructs, promptly retreated."

This theory was meant to be tried out by Ortolf the Master Horologist at the battle of Sahnenburg, where he had placed twenty constructs in a circle, meaning for them to charge each other for a few rounds before the resulting lightning should have been directed towards the enemy.  The result of the experiment is not known, as neither of the opposing armies nor Sahnenburg could be found afterwards."

This shows that the creative art of the Hoburg crafter is inferior to his peers in other societies.  Should the Empire spend its time at making constructs, undoubtedly some more artistic expressions than spiders would emerge."

descr "According to the accounts of the head Horologist, the Iron Fly was intended to be a flying annoyance to the regular troops, particularly useful against archers.  He disputes any claims that he can use the the Iron Flies to spy on ordinary Hoburg citizens, saying that he has no way of seeing through the eyes of iron flies with the help of mirrors or other scrying devices.  That an Iron Fly has been seen hovering just outside the window of the changing room for the contestant of the Miss Pumpkin contest is a just a mere coincidence and should not be given any consideration."

newmonster    "Iron Ant"                                                 # 1095
descr "A major problem with the soldier constructs was found during a battle that was fought on the rocky slopes of Rusty Mountains, when the Dwarven troops realized that the soldier constructs were easily toppled.  When they fell on their backs, they had problems getting back on their feet, because of their considerable weight.  A temporary solution was to give the soldier and horror constructs a third or even fourth leg, but they proved difficult to manage and they could walk of in the wrong direction in the middle of a fight.  A better solution was suggested by an apprentice who made some clockwork toy insects for the local clockwork toy construct races, and noted how his ants and bugs were much more difficult to topple by tilting the board or blowing hard on them.  His ideas were then promptly stolen by the senior Horologist."

However, the deal went sour when some fingers were found in the fish pickles that the Hoburghers had traded.  Now the Iron Scorpions instead serve the army and with their outlandish looks, they are quite popular in military parades."

descr "When Gruber Hassleboff first begun his work on an entertainment device everyone was excited. Imagine seeing the world from above, looking down and not up on deer and men. Hoburghers across the realm gathered to the great autumn festival to experience first hand the joy of looking down on foreigners, especially invited for the occasion. The great iron wheel, adorned with gems illuminating the festival grounds, was pulled by a procession of clockwork soldiers likewise glowing in the evening. The awed Hoburghers pushed and squeezed to get in line for the first ride. However, Gruber Hassleboff, famous for his prodigious weed consumption, was not the genious he claimed to be and his grand iron wheel, when loaded with Hoburgher riders, started to malfunction, rotating at unintended speed, only to suddenly stop, flinging horrified Hoburghers through the air far beyond the festival grounds. Gruber was banned from the festival for life, but being a Hoburgher he did not despair. Instead he approached the Burgmeister and was allowed to develop the Ferrous Wheel and remake it into a self propelled siege device, flinging large boulders instead of Hoburghers. As siege devices go the Ferrous Wheel has an unparalleled rate of fire, but the boulders it throws are small compared to those of regular catapults."

descr "Despite the apparent coherence of the Hoburg society, there is some opposition to the current order.  Being bested in an election to the title of Burgmeister, the ancestor of the current Markgraf decided to withdraw himself from the Hoburg society altogether, setting up his domain as that of a Graf, modeled on the human Barons.  For a few generations this remote area of the Hoburg society was more or less self-sufficient, if a bit leaner than their neighbors.  The Markgraf managed to live well off of his subjects and no dissenters to his rule survived to tell any tales.  Many Hoburghers of ill repute have found a refuge in the towns of the Markgrafdom, which had already broken with the customs of the Hoburg society.  As the Markgraf's domains are more barren and worn down than the rest the Hoburg lands, the Markgrafs have tried every means available to improve the lot of their subjects and themselves."

newmonster    "Malefic Markgraf"                                         # 1099
descr "Though it long appeared as if the Nekromants in fact ruled the Markgraf's domains, some recent news seem to indicate that the Markgraf was indeed in control the whole time, or at least tried to be.  Spending the money earned from manufactures and settled lawsuits on research in order to investigate an old rumor in the Markgraf annals, he hoped to gain power for himself.  We at the College of Cerebro Magni were happy to be able to present the results of our studies, which indicated that the Nekromant could aid the Markgraf in achieving a status of powerful undeath.  The disadvantage being that he requires the blood of living people on a constant basis, though not necessarily that of Hoburghers.  There are some uncertainties as to how he received our results, because the envoys that were sent with the results seem to have disappeared during their travels.  However, the Markgraf has since paid the monies due and even offered a stipend for young scholars to travel to the Markgrafdom to study."

newmonster    "Malefic Master"                                           # 1100
descr "Though the original vampiric Markgraf was rather limited in his resources, he retained the immense hunger of his kind.  According to some bookkeeping that reached our College, the Markfgraf seemed to have spent most of the revenues of his undead factories importing a steady run of black sausage, black pudding and fresh pig's blood from their Hoburg neighbors.  This in combination with a steady decline in population in the villages seems to indicate that the Markgraf tried to satiate his hunger with blood.  Though no study by itself seems to indicate that an increased intake of blood would help developing vampiric abilities, at best it would placate an ordinary Vampire, while a regular Hoburgher would just be nauseated, if not full.  The reason may instead be found in the fake blood produced by the Horticulturist in order to water down the blood barrels.  Though the herbal mixtures could not be shown to have provided any benefit in smaller amounts, or even normal amounts, it is possible that a high concentration of the herbal mixture would make a difference."

descr "According to a certain ill-reputed doctor, the art of reviving someone is dependent on two factors – memory and hunger. At times a revived corpse will only retain its memory but no willpower in which case it becomes a ghost, none of its previous hungers drives it on and it is just a lingering.  In the opposite case it is just the hunger driving it.  As is easily understood it is difficult to revive a hoburg and have the resulting corpse not being overwhelmed by hunger.  The easiest way to let the subject of the revivification retain some memories would be to start the reanimation process just a few minutes before the subject dies.  As such it is not a popular procedure, but lured by the promise of eternal life and eternal dinners, some of the Markgrafs let themselves be talked into this by the nekromants."

descr "It is believed that the Nekromants established themselves in the Markgrafdom a few decades ago, after being banned in Hoburg.  Though the Hoburghers generally lack an understanding and prowess in the arts of magic, some seem to still have an understanding for the art of Necromancy, perhaps due to their close association with the soil.  A few years ago there was even a Hoburg Necromancer, Sigismunda Strobel, at this very College, who was not without insight into the Dark Arts.  Recently the Nekromants gained access to the Markgraf's council, because they cooperated in finding a way to copy the Hoburg manufacturies.  Being well-versed in the art of preservation, one of the first manufacturies to be populated solely by undead workers was the manufactury of 'Hermann Fleischer's Fine Pickled Meats'.  There were some complaints of fingers in the pickles, which pitched the Markgraf into a lengthy legal battle with the Fleischer family."

Nevertheless, some worrying reports talk about large amounts of armed and armored small skeletons among the graveyards in the Markgrafdom.  However, reports are difficult to come by, because most of the citizens of the Markgrafdom know to keep quiet and will close their doors to any visiting strangers."

However, the Nekromant's ability to cheat death differs somewhat from their full Necromancer counterparts.  Being more associated with the soil and earth than arcane magics, the result of the twice-born ritual is a regular corpse with some remembrance of their former life."

However, the scheme failed, because the ghostly remains could not be contained, and the Ghosts would bicker incessantly, forcing the Nekromants to move their premises."

If proper preparations were made his demise is not an issue, his death might even be orchestrated to allow him to pass into a form better suited to his dark arts. The Grand Ghost Nekromant can pass the veil that separates Hades from Elysium and he might be sent to that dark land to expand the dominion of the Markgraf."

There is of course a lack of initiative from the Thrall, which is why they are often set to death-defying simple missions.  Some adversaries to the method do point out that it is not an economically sound way of leading troops, even though they need not be paid."

newmonster    "Hobmark Hammerer"                                         # 1120
descr "The troop that differ most from what you can find in the Hoburg regiments is the Hammerer.  Though such news rarely make it out of the Markgraf's domains it is said that the undead created by lesser Nekromants will fail from time to time and wreck havoc at the factories.  It was early quite clear that short swords and pikes proved ineffective against their undead, whereas a hammerblow to the head works equally well on longdead, soulless or living opponent.  However, in time it appears as if the original Hammerers thought their hammers to be crude as they were often mistaken for smith apprentices.  Looking for something more dignified, they worked with some local smiths, who definitely did not want to be mistaken for the crude Hobmark Hammerers, to produce a hammer that both could strike through the skulls of the undead and an enemies platemail while looking stylish.  After a few hundred hammers had been delivered some hog riders noticed that the hammers looked quite a bit like the louse flinging tools they use in their games with the notorious hog louse.  The hammers were then called Louse Hammers.  If one asks a Hammerer the answer would instead be that the hammers are the trademark of Luzern's Fine Metal Wares which gives it its name, but as they are pretentious and snobby, it is obvious that the former origin of the name rings closer to the truth.  The Hammerers are still required to carry a small hammer as it has also been noted in the fielded armies that a soulless that has lost a limb can be easily if somewhat temporarily fixed with a hammer and a nail."

Though slow and sluggish, they worked both day and night, thus earning good money for their proprietor.  Among the first batches it was noted however, that the undead Hoburgher would still stop for second or third breakfasts even without needing to eat more than the occasional brain."

This might not be as effective as if the spear was wielded by a living Hoburgher, but soulless are cheaper than the living."

newmonster    "Little Ghoul"                                             # 1132
descr "During experiments with Soulless workers and in an attempt at giving them more independence, a somewhat stronger and more durable breed was discovered.  The problem was however, that the insatiable hunger of the Hoburghers did not cease, but would often be directed towards the nearest living creature.  From a necro-economic point of view, this was a breakthrough, as the saliva of the Little Ghoul was viral and would create a new, if chewed upon, Little Ghoul of the person so bitten.  Considering the rather small population in the Markgraf's domains, there would soon be a problem with getting enough fresh corpses, though this was solved in a rather Hoburg manner.  All citizens of the Hobmark are offered a contract that will give a certain amount of money for the use of their body after death.  After the nature of the Ghouls became known, most of the citizens so contracted have demanded to become ghouls after their death in order to not lose their ability to eat."

descr "In the contract between the markgraf guardians and the Markgraf, a small clause can be read that they should serve the Graf beyond the point of death, both his or theirs.  Though some of the guardians do follow their ward in to the everlasting embrace of undeadness, most are not so willing to serve.  Due to the clause, and the almost sacred nature of business-contracts between Hoburgs, they are bound to follow them.  The unwillingness to actually die turns them into more vicious and less aware creatures.  As they almost act on instinct one has to beware of his bodyguards whenever one is in a meeting with the Ghoul Baron."

Such is the nature of this fire, that it will cause the flesh of the living to decay and shrivel within minutes."

newmonster    "Minotaur Brigand"                                         # 1140
descr "Minotaurs resemble large satyrs with bull faces.  Everything a satyr is, a minotaur is, but worse.  If you find a satyr ugly, a minotaur is uglier.  If you find a satyr obnoxious, a minotaur is more so.  If you find a satyr easily angered, a minotaur is doubly so.  If you are bothered by the carnal urges of a satyr, you are advised to avoid minotaurs altogether.  Satyrs are too small to be anything but annoying, but the bodily stature of minotaurs makes them think they are compatible with centaurs.  Why Gaia created minotaurs has been the subject of many lengthy discussions at the academy.  The general opinion is that they were created in the ancient days to fight for Gaia's children.  Now however, with the coming of civilization, their usefulness is at an end and most of us advocate a birth control program, but we must remind ourselves that minotaurs are a part of our cultural legacy and we don't want them to disappear entirely."

descr "Moving in flocks in the mountains, the wolf tribe is always to be feared as they would lie in wait for any lone traveler or a poor traveler that falls behind his caravan.  Dressed in the remains of wolves or tattooed with hellish grins on their faces, the wolf tribe is generally a fearsome sight.  Even more fearsome is their tradition to slaughter and devour one of their defeated enemies right after a battle."

Dressed in antlers and the skin of a deer one can only assume that it is the shaman who is leading her tribe in the ways of the deer.  It is said that when the shaman is old enough she will leave her tribe to travel with a bevy of deer.  This is most likely why most of the shamans found had been mauled by wolves."

Whenever they get a chance, they will capture civilized men as slaves and herd them along with their armies of savages and brutes.  The priests of their kingdom have somehow acquired magical powers from their Demon Gods.  The Priest King is supposed to be blessed by the Warrior God of the Sun and he is followed by sacred Sun Warriors and Jaguar Warriors, which according to Monforte, are fed with human flesh."

descr "The Teotl of War is the main God of the Priest Kings' pantheon.  He is the son of the Bloody Mother and was born aware and fully armed, after she was impregnated with a ball of feathers.  He slew his siblings and made himself ruler of the world, or so the legend says.  Before the unexplained disappearance of Guillaume's Templar army there were rumors that the Priest King had been devoured and his people were led by an incarnation of the Teotl of War.  If the demonic Teotl gods are indeed able to manifest their powers and appear in Elysium when called by human sacrifice, we have reason to call a full scale Crusade against the savages of the southern realms."

descr "The Tlahuelpuchi is a blood-sucking demon-witch that primarily attacks infants.  Like all Witches, the Tlahuelpuchi come to their power in puberty, and there is still no known means to discern their true nature before that.  It is even possible that they, and other Witches, are corrupted at puberty, and are not inherently depraved.  The Tlahuelpuchi are able to change their shape and therefore difficult to capture, but some have been caught sneaking about in our army camps.  Being Witches, they respond well to dunking in water and trial by fire."

The Plumed Serpent is revered by the savages of Aztlan as messengers of the Bloody Mother, and there are numerous reports of the beasts being used by the Priest Kings in warfare.  They are fed slaves and oxen, but the current Priest King has fed several of our missionaries to these horrible monsters to display his displeasure with the righteousness of our cause."

Sure, some of the animals they respect, like the jaguar, are fierce and somewhat noble, almost like the lion; but most animals they revere and worship are just ignoble beasts of questionable virtues. Frogs, toads and snakes all have a special place in the minds of the savages, but stranger still is the belief that Nahualli sorcerers can form spiritual bonds to turkeys, or that they can change shape into turkeys. Thus turkeys are reared and fed the best of foods, only to be slaughtered and eaten, should they not fullfill the expectations of its owner."

descr "The four Chaac are four demonic servants of the Teotl of the Sky believed to govern the four directions of his aerial realm. According to Azltan myth they gather storms and winds and send them to the four directions to Elysium to punish sinners and wrong-doers. Since everyone is a wrong-doer in Aztlan tradition there should be perpetual storms raging across Elysium. Since this is not the case we can safely assume that these demonic entities are not as powerful as their misguided adherents claim. Unfortunately the savages do not listen to reason and if we are to eradicate their abhorrent beliefs the only option is death."

descr "The four Chaac are four demonic servants of the Teotl of the Sky believed to govern the four directions of his aerial realm. According to Azltan myth they gather storms and winds and send them to the four directions to Elysium to punish sinners and wrong-doers. Since everyone is a wrong-doer in Aztlan tradition there should be perpetual storms raging across Elysium. Since this is not the case we can safely assume that these demonic entities are not as powerful as their misguided adherents claim. Unfortunately the savages do not listen to reason and if we are to eradicate their abhorrent beliefs the only option is death."

# [named]     "Ehecatl"
descr "The Teotl of the Sky one of the Aztlan Demon Gods. He is the ruler of a realm from which comes winds and storms. Worship of the Teotl seems to focus on placating the demon and make sure his wrath is directed at other realms rather than the Aztlan kingdom. Not much in the manner of blessings would come from a lord such as this. The Teotl of the Sky is also called upon as a bringer of war, and its status as a god of war is second only to the Teotl of War itself. The Teotl of War is associated with everything that flies, and warriors dedicated to his cause are indeed able to take to the skies and fly with the aid of their feathered cloaks, a fact that have surprised our less imaginative generals at several occasions."

newmonster    "Tlaloque of the North"                                    # 1223
descr "The four Tlaloques are four demonic servants of the Teotl of Rain believed to govern the four directions of Tlalocan, the paradise of Rain. According to the myths of the savages they herald the arrival of the demon god himself. While some superstitious generals have declined to eradicate savage villages during the rainy season on the reasoning that these rain demons could be attracted and eventually cause their master to manifest, such hesitation will not aid our cause and could only benefit the false prophets of the Teotl of Rain, who would then be able to perform their vile practices unchecked."

# [named]     "Tlaloc"
descr "The Teotl of Rain is a God of the Priest Kings' pantheon.  He is the ruler of a paradise from which comes rain, fortune and fertility.  So far the only blessings we have seen him deliver are torrential rains and overly damp forests.  The savages clearly do not understand the concept of a benign God, and their religion is focused on placating demonic entities out of fear rather than humble devotion.  The stone idols representing the Teotl of Rain have a resemblance to toads, and his priests are often accompanied by strange Toad Warriors.  Increasing numbers of toads in the temple gardens have worried the Pontiff, who has placed a bounty of one silver piece for every toad or frog leg delivered to his staff.  Evil rumors claim that the gathering of frogs has culinary rather than religious reasons."

descr "The Tzitzimitl is a demon of the Stellar Sphere.  Since this is the origin of Angels, most scholars agree that the Tzitzimitl were once divine beings, punished for their sins and banished to some lower plane of existence.  In their depraved state they readily accepted the bloody sacrifices and attention of the Priest Kings and fell into further wickedness.  Now they have fully succumbed under the sway of evil and are without redemption.  The Star Demons are forever cursed with an appearance to match their sins, with huge blue-skinned bodies, scorpion tails, claws for hands and feathered arms.  The only thing pure about them are the star crowns placed on their foreheads to forever remind them of what they have lost."

descr "The Onaqui is a jungle demon only reported in obscure myths.  Since the savages of Aztlan are mostly illiterate, it comes as no surprise that they tell ever more fanciful stories about the unknown perils of the dark woods.  The Onaqui is possibly an anointed Ozelotl, but according to the savages, its powers are vastly superior to those of the Jaguar Fiends.  It supposedly emerges at night to feed on the hearts of men.  In the unlikely event that a real Onaqui would be encountered, it should be banishable by any righteous priest."

descr "The Teotl of the Night is perhaps the most terrifying of the Aztlan Demon Gods. He is the ruler of a realm of shadows and eternal darkness. His blessings are a short life in fear and a promise of a gruesome nightly death. The demon god is supposed to stalk the night and slay the living to satiate his eternal hunger. Why anyone would worship theis beast is beyond comprehension and one would assume that it is only to avoid the fate promised by the beast. However the savages seem to consider him worthy of reverence and there is actually a priestly order that worship the Monster of the Night, and an order of sacred warriors who follow their lord, subsisting exclusively on human blood."

descr "Caravans traveling through Aztlan territories have reported that they have been attacked by skeletal women in bridal dress when camping at certain crossroads.  These white women cause madness and disease and even wake the dead to attack the living.  The Aztlani savages consider the spectres honored women, the spirits of those who have died in the battle of childbirth.  In truth the apparitions are the souls of remarkably heinous sinners, banned from a peaceful afterlife in the Blessed Lands.  The reverence given them by the savage priests is yet another display of the abominable order of their backward kingdom."

descr "The Bolon-Ti-Ku are demons of the Underworld called by the wicked priests of Aztlan.  Their origin is disputed and while most scholars agree that the Bolon-Ti-Ku probably are of Infernal nature like the other servants of the Teotl Demon Gods, there are some sages who make convincing arguments in favor of placing them under the rule of Orcus, the Prince of Death.  This could mean that the Priest Kings and their subservient priests are not limited to conjuring Infernal forces, but might be able to summon the Stygian dead as well.  We have not yet captured a Goetic Master capable of summoning a Bolon-Ti-Ku, so the question remains unsolved."

descr "The Teotl of the Underworl is one of the Aztlan Demon Gods. He is the ruler of the realm of the dead, and although terrible and evil, is portrayed as a less warlike than the other demon gods. The priests worshiping the Teotl probably proposes less of a threat than the followers of the other demon gods. The Aztlani claims that those who die end up in the realm of the dead under the rule of the Teotl of the Underworld. We can only be thankful if this would be true, since it would mean that we, even if we were to suffer in purgatory, would never encounter the savages in our afterlife. More likely they will all burn in Hell, making that place even more horrible to those that have sinned."

newmonster    "Dryad Hoplite"                                            # 1232
descr "While most dryads are trained as priestess of the Old Ways there are a few who have adopted a martial way of life.  How this can be accepted by the Dryad Queens is beyond our imagination.  To put the ladies of the wild in the midst of battle should be in accordance with neither the interest of the Dryad Queens nor the will of Gaia as expressed through the Old Ways.  In fact Dryad Hoplites is a new and alarming occurrence.  In ancient times there were no gleaming bronze armors for dryads to wear and the dryads were properly trained in the sacred groves.  The mastery of bronze working should not be used as an excuse to allow us to field armies of our beloved dryads.  Regardless of their martial skills and gifts of Gaia the dryads of our time should get a new role where their talents could be appreciated by all.  Music, dancing and possibly cooking could be areas of expertise where we would appreciate the skills of the dryads."

descr "How endearing are they not, the Dryads of the sacred groves, beloved of Gaia.  In the ancient past they ruled the tribes and voiced the will of Gaia.  Once perhaps, their leadership was needed to reign in the wild nature of our tribes, but now their old ways are no longer needed and are but an endearing memory of times long gone.  However, it is an irrefutable fact that they are closer to Gaia than any other race, with the possible exception of the Pans.  Only the blessings of an Anointed Dryad can endow a sacred grove with the primal blessing of Gaia.  Fortunately we don't need the blessings of the old ways any more, and the ceremonial role of the Dryads fills no function in a civilized society.  
Dryads are incomparably cute, and according to some, gifted with aphrodisiac beauty that protects them against enemies.  It is true that most humans seems to lose their mind and just stare in awe or bewilderment when approached by a Dryad.  Satyrs seem to share the human sentiments and their wild behavior is calmed when Dryads are present."

The strength of a centaur warrior is unmatched among all civilized races of Elysium.  Not by man, not by dwarf, not by troll and not by fiend, would a centaur meet an equal on the field of battle.  Those trained as warriors in the sacred groves use their anger not as a liability, but as a force to use in battle.  Centaur warriors have occasionally adopted hit and run tactics, hiding in dense forests.  This has given us a reputation as uncivilized cowards that most sensible centaurs try to refute."

descr "Sometimes a centaur is born with a white pelt.  According to the Old Ways this is the mark of Gaia.  The white centaurs are considered sacred and are trained in the sacred groves to become champions or priests of Gaia.

While some of them become priests, most of them are destined to live and die as warriors of a lost cause.  We pity them and their families, but we can do little, as the protagonists of the Old Ways are still influential in our young civilization."

descr "Centaurides, female centaurs, are the most beautiful of all of Gaia's children.  With shiny pelts and almond eyes they epitomize the beauty of the wild.  Those who still live in the ancient forests are as wild and lustful as the males, although less prone to anger and much more noble.  They, like male centaurs, do not wear clothing, which is only to be expected as long as the dryads cling to the old ways.  Centaurides who leave the forests are of course quick to don modest blankets and clothing."

descr "You would expect us all to enjoy the gifts of higher culture, embrace peace and let competent stallions manage our wars.  This is not the case however.  It is a matter of great concern that some daughters of highly respected fathers have abandoned civilization and more or less turned back to the old ways.  It is true that centaurides once fought side by side with male centaurs, but you would expect this practice to end now that civilization has established itself.  These unrestrained young mares don armors and join our armies as cataphracts.  I have even met commanders who claim that the army would be at a loss should we ban the centaurides from military service.  This is of course nonsense, and it points to the problems of having too little cultural education in the military academies."

descr "While it should be regarded as highly unconventional to have mares fighting beside stallions, it is obvious that this is not always the case.  Some generals have no clear concept of how warfare should be run.  They point to battles of old where centaur and centauride fought side by side, as if the old ways were right.  We are civilized now, and with that comes responsibility.  The new ways don't demand of us to put our daughters at risk.  The only comfort to be found in the recent appearance of steel-clad centaurides is the fact that they mainly use crossbows and do not charge head first into battle as they would have done centuries ago.  The prudence and sensibility for which centaurides are known, while obviously disregarded in their choice of career, still seems to affect their choice of weapons and role in the battles."

descr "Consider the common Satyr, it is wild, lustful and unrefined.  A slave under his carnal urges with a mind constrained by what his eyes can see and what his nose can smell.  Is he not an example of what will befall us, should we fail to elevate ourselves from the ancestry so eagerly praised by the self-proclaimed Keepers of Traditions.  Only with wisdom, patience and discipline can we hope to tame the wildness found at the heart of every newborn satyr.  Bestiality is in our nature and satyrs are even worse afflicted than we are.  Only when led by wise centaurs can the satyrs hope to elevate themselves from their primal nature.  To those who would say that the alluring ways of the dryads can tame the mind of a satyr equally well, I would reply not.  Not in a thousand years, as we have seen.  Enticing the satyrs will not elevate them from their primal instincts, only avert their most unrestrained actions in anticipation of future rewards."

descr "Some satyrs have shown remarkable restraint and proper manners.  While some scholars claim that they have lost their connection with Gaia, we can easily refute this by looking at ourselves.  No centaur, civilized or not, has lost the connection to our divine mother.  We all prefer the restrained behavior of the civilized satyrs to that of their lustful kin.  Military commanders have found a use for these somewhat calmer satyrs and train them to use crossbows.  Since they do not charge the enemy as soon as they are provoked, they are invaluable to the military."

descr "Minotaurs resemble large satyrs with bull faces.  Everything a satyr is, a minotaur is, but worse.  If you find a satyr ugly, a minotaur is uglier.  If you find a satyr obnoxious, a minotaur is more so.  If you find a satyr easily angered, a minotaur is doubly so.  If you are bothered by the carnal urges of a satyr, you are advised to avoid minotaurs altogether.  Satyrs are too small to be anything but annoying, but the bodily stature of minotaurs makes them think they are compatible with centaurs.  Why Gaia created minotaurs has been the subject of many lengthy discussions at the academy.  The general opinion is that they were created in the ancient days to fight for Gaia's children.  Now however, with the coming of civilization, their usefulness is at an end and most of us advocate a birth control program, but we must remind ourselves that minotaurs are a part of our cultural legacy and we don't want them to disappear entirely."
descr "It is disputed whether the Minotaur is a beast or a humanoid, because it has been seen associating with both Brigands and Deer.  That it can wield and use weapons effectively speaks for humanoid, but the fact that the Minotaur cannot speak indicates it is a beast.  Until more research has been done, it is safest to assume that the Minotaurs are beasts and stay away or kill them when possible."

My military friends claim that minotaurs are less driven by their carnal urges than satyrs, and are easier to dress up in furs or armor.  With some protection a charging minotaur can often survive long enough to allow centaur warriors to mop up the scattered forces left in the wake of the charging bulls and ensure victory."

descr "Although you might be fooled to believe that minotaurs have adopted civilized ways, they are still the obnoxious brutes they always were, armor or not.  We have managed to make armors that fit well enough not to itch or irritate the brutes.

descr "Harpies gladly follow armies, perhaps because they are attracted to noise and action, perhaps because they like to cause mischief.  Recently a clever commander managed to use nets to catch harpies and strapped bronze breastplates on the birds.  Since the harpies have no hands they were stuck with the armor.  After a short period of sulking they accepted their fate.  To increase their efficiency in battle they were equipped with an array of copper feathers ready to be released upon ground targets.  The harpies have since come to enjoy the copper feathers and protective armors and now there are even some harpies that voluntarily adopts the cuirasses."

Just like the Kithaironic lion, this huge lion also has an unpiercable skin and it could withstand any number of arrows without feeling more than an itch.  Disciplining a nemean lion would be very difficult as it is unlikely to feel anything short of a maul to the leg, but luckily this is seldom required as the nemean lion is smarter than its smaller brethren."

newmonster    "Scourge King"                                             # 1281
descr "At times the Scourge Lord will assume so much power and land, albeit withering at this point, that he will call himself a King, and thus is often mentioned in the journals as a Scourge King.
 This, however, is a faulty view as the title of king requires both a bloodline and a righteous claim on the throne, as is true with the most noble benefactor of our university. The Scourge king ought rather to be called a Scourge Usurper, Despot or Tyrant. I would personally choose to use the title of Scourge Usurper.
 In order to appear more majestic, the Scourge King often uses magic and simple tricks to enhance that in which nature has failed him. Special shoes will make him look taller, golden dye and skillful combing will cover any grey hairs or bald patches, and through illusory magic any blotches on his skin are covered."

descr "Ever so often, a few times each century, the annoying menace that is the Scourge Lord plagues the realms. Hidden behind spiky armor and a golden mask, he seeks out other disruptive elements across the realm and begins a reign of destruction, disruption and decay.
 Where the Scourge Lord gets his devastating powers is still unknown and the source of much speculation. The lack of proper communication beyond scornful quips and twisted facts makes it difficult to learn anything about them.
 It has been suggested that the power lies within the mask and the armor, and that the Scourge Lord arises whenever a simple adventurer or farmer of very low nature unearths the golden mask and the accompanying spiked shoulder pad. It is easy to imagine how the vile Scourge-Lord-to-be dons the mask, disregarding any pieces of crumbling flesh still clinging to the golden mask.
 Within the mask, and now the Scourge Lord, lies the power to drain the lands and also the minds of people, leaving them both as desolate, ashen places."

descr "Though the Scourge Lord is fickle and paranoid, he will often surround himself with sycophantic assistants who will lead his troops and help spread the influence of the Scourge Lord.
 These assistants are the Scourge Heralds. Not only do they engage in the crimes of more common villains, e.g. rob merchants, take over villages and mines, harass the population and kill the innocent, they are also the main instrument by which the Scourge Lord depletes the landscape of Elysium.
 The Heralds will erect pillars and steles whose surfaces are inscribed with destructive jokes, offensive rants and counterfactual news. Through these brainworms the Scourge Lord drains the surrounding lands of all their lifeforce, leaving a withered desert behind them."

descr "It is widely known that mercenaries will sell anything or anyone if just paid enough. it is also a common fact that they should not be paid before an executed job as their loyalties are fickle. However, the Scourge Lord offers almost anything the mercenaries will ask for if they just sell their soul and take part of the dark life force collected by the Scourge Lord. Though many eagerly accept, hoping for loads of gold, few are aware of the cost. After they have undergone the transformation they will become stronger, but find themselves craving human flesh, rather than gold or the items once precious to them."

Though individually craven they are utterly terrified of their peers and leaders, and would storm any fortress on their master's command.
 Though they do seem human by appearance and lineage, it has been speculated that many of the henchmen of the Scourge Lord are in fact descended from the lowest kinds of trolls, as an unnaturally large number of them appear to have been living in basements and outhouses prior to joining the ranks of the Scourge Lord."

 While the mounted goat riders in the emeraldwars of 1164 caused much disruption in mountainous villages, the goats had a tendency to gobble through not only the water but also the waterskins, leaving the Scourge Lord's army stranded on a mountain top for about three years.
 Another attempt was made using mules. While mules are excellent for carrying the supplies of an army, their charges were a bit too much of a spectacle.
 After a large part of the army was lost during trials involving giant centipedes, the Scourge Lords settled upon camels, in spite of their good natured demeanor."

descr "The famed kingdom of the desert raiders was crushed in the trade wars of 1145, but their legend has lived on until this day. When the Scourge Lord decided to use camels for his cavalry, some of the most daring among the riders took upon themselves to assume the role of the old sheikhs, having been impressed by how they raided and pillaged desert settlements in the sagas."

newmonster    "Myrmecoleon"                                              # 1291
descr "The Myrmecoleon is another result of the terrifying breeding pits. Somehow, probably involving the expenditure of an extreme amount of life force , the Scourge Lord has managed to get a lion and an ant to mate. It is assumed that the pairing must consist of a male lion and an ant queen, as no other would produce such a fearsome creature.
 We have not, however, been able to deduce why the front is that of a lion and the back and legs those of an ant. If the Myrmecoleon follows the same laws as a centaur, we can conclude that the nobler part is made up from the head and torso, whereas the legs and lower body is made from the lesser of the two creatures combined.
 I assume that one can use this rule and calculate the nobility of the different parts of a chimera. However, many scholars are still occupied with the question of, "Is the sum of the parts more or less noble than the origin?""

descr "Sometimes the Scourge Lord is mistaken for one of the many snake cultists that roam the countryside, due the large snakes they sometimes summon. However, this is obviously false, as the Scourge Lord would never worship anything but his own ego.
 The Apophis is a beast of terrifying size and it is not really known how it reaches such a size. It is said that they are force fed large amounts of rotting meat, however our own experiments with force feeding snakes are hitherto unsuccessful. Wickham the naturalist was severely poisoned in the last round of experiments."

newmonster    "Monster Scarab"                                           # 1293
descr "It is not known why the Monster Scarab rolls enormous piles of dung, but it is of no surprise that the Scourge Lord allies himself with this most vile of creatures. The Monster Scarab, when not employed by vile forces, moves along an indiscernible pattern rolling an ever-growing perfect sphere of dung before itself. Some lower creatures, like the goblins and their kind, believe that our world is a gigantic ball of dung rolled forward by an enormous Monster Scarab, and that the dung balls the ordinary Monster Scarabs roll are just smaller worlds with smaller creatures.
 That theory is of course nonsense, as was proven when Philomena the sage excavated such a ball and found nothing other than maggots, worms, and smaller insects. The notion that we are all maggots may be suitable for a lowly goblin, but it is of course an absurd notion when it comes to humans.
 A more scientifically sound theory is that the dung ball reflects the scarab's close affiliation to the element of earth and that by gathering dung and dirt in a ball, they create what is in essence the egg from which the next scarab is born.
 It has also been proposed that since they are one of the one hundred and three known abominations, they are hiding their appearance unto El behind that great ball."

descr "Our informants tell us that the Scourge Worm, just like most summons of the Scourge Lord, is beckoned to serve the Scourge Lord with the use of a cadaver broth enhanced with life force. The broth, with its stench of rot and devastation, will act as a lure for any nearby vile creature that is already infesting the scourged lands. Among the creatures attracted to the broth are the Scourge Worms. The Scourge Worm usually inhabits the rotting carcasses of large monsters - the larger the monster, the larger the worm."

descr "One of the classic rot dwellers, the centipede can usually be found under rocks and in old walls, eating anything old and rotting. The Dark Centipedes are far larger and are sometimes found in dark cellars and abandoned ruins. Due to their size they can no longer hide under small rocks, but instead need to hide in caverns or under partially collapsed floors.
 It is uncertain why some centipedes grow to this large size. It is likely that consuming the rotting flesh of certain monsters or undead imbues the ordinary centipede with this size and power."

newmonster    "Dark Serpent"                                             # 1296
descr "Whenever a snake or serpent is force-fed life force, its body is not the only thing that will grow. The Dark Serpents are not only venomous but they are somehow also imbued with dark powers, which allow them to shed some spell-like powers around them. Certain scholars will claim that such is the power of the life force - that it will change both the body and mind of the serpent.
 This is a far too simple explanation and we believe the more reasonable explanation is found in a combination of exposure to venomous vapors and the dark life force of the Scourge Lord. We all know how bad vapors may affect the brain. If you live your entire life in a swamp, your brain will be affected by the cold and slimy vapors and you will become lazy, apathetic and evil. This is the result of your brain becoming mushy and poisoned from the venomous vapors.  The snake produces such ill vapors each time it attacks a foe, thus immersing its own brain in foul air. A brain thusly saturated in venom will be extraordinarily susceptible to evil forces. Thus when fed the life force of the Scourge Lord, the venomous brain starts emanating evil projections onto its perceived foes."

After creating a breeding pit enhanced with life force, it is only a matter of luring the two innocent animals into the pit, where an unnatural union will produce a basilisk. Such is the power of the breeding pit that any creatures which fall within it will start mating regardless of species or size. Woe unto the unlucky person who falls into such a pit."

descr "The basic giant ant. It usually resides within the ant hill, carrying food or materials, and building or repairing sections of the hill. It is thought that they may be a very good basis for polymorphed slaves, or that they may be used as the brains of slave constructs. However, all attempts to do this have proven disastrous, and further discussions of ant-driven constructs are discouraged by our wise dean."

descr "The soldier ants are formidable fighters and are known to take on creatures that are far bigger than them. The ants are usually more than a match for any creature their own size, so do not bet on a dog in a dog vs. ant fight.
 Their powerful carapaces are a highly sought after material by many adventurers who prefer it over steel or iron. However, being rather difficult to manipulate and reshape, they are often made into scale-like armors.
 The ants seem to prefer to fight in formation, which is odd as their natural habitat are the narrow passages of the ant hill in which they live and fight in the defense of. This requires further research and I have asked for a stipend to capture 20 or so soldier ants, which I will compel to fight other creatures under various circumstances in the arena.
 Note to self. I need to find someone willing to paint the ants in different colors."

While the Scourge Lord is a creature of chaos, the ants prefer order, even if their order sometimes brings chaos to common people, who do not appreciate having their larders emptied by aggressive ants.
 However, while the Scourge Lord summons the ants and feeds them life force and rotten corpses, the Ant Queen will act on her own and occupy herself with creating an anthill from where she will spread her ant-rule. Soon the ants will spread out, and almost cause as much chaos for the Scourge Lord as they do for the rest of the country. The ants are even known to have eaten and plundered villages and cities belonging to the Scourge Lord himself."

newmonster    "Black Spider"                                             # 1304
descr "The giant arachnid grows to the size of a large dog. Its main habitats are dense and dark jungles. Just like its smaller counterparts, it has eight hairy and all too fast legs. Its favored prey consists of wild pigs and explorers. They hunt by encasing their victims in spider webs, which then slowly dissolve the corpse, creating a kind of a corpse broth.
 For some ungodly reason, some of the local populations in its native region have made a culinary specialty of half dissolved pigs or goats which they grab from the clutches of the spiders. Usually they lead the pig there and wait one day before retrieving it, mainly to make sure that they do not eat an explorer by mistake. According to reports, the webs will cure the meat so that after one day it is very tender and comes with quite a bit of sting to the tongue.
 The giant arachnid also has hundreds of beady eyes looking straight at you and strong mandibles ready to tear into your flesh. Why anyone would choose to tame such a vile creature is beyond comprehension.
 Some reports claim that they have observed pigs and spiders being led to the breeding pits of the Scourge Lord. Is he trying to create a pig-spider, the horror? There is no telling what such a creature may be capable of."

descr "It is common among spellcasters to construct guardians to protect their assets while not at home. These are often large statues imbued with some power from the caster. Being constructs, they usually give better value for one's resources than mere soldiers and no energy has to be spent to make them move outside of the confines of the laboratory, cave, mine or whatever structure the caster chooses to protect.
 Construction of such a guardian should be done with caution, as was proven by the many times Zhakra the Ancient forgot the password for her own guardian in the library - with burnt books and blazed apprentices as a result.
 But turning back to the guardians of the Scourge Lord. The guardians, like everything else the Scourge Lord touches, lack in taste and artistic skill. Something they often make up for with gaudy details and as much gilt as is possible."

newmonster    "Eagle King"                                               # 1309
descr "Although the winged people call themselves the Airya, it is a name that is rarely heard, and more often than not mispronounced by their representative on the ground. By the ignorant populace they are often called the winged ones. However, such a name would be utterly ridiculous as it could refer to anything from bees to demons. My learned colleague, Betram the Loud, has suggested calling them Cloudites, but such a name would indicate that they are one people, when they are more often than not confined to an ancient cloud castle and a few neighboring villages. I will therefore use the name Cloud Dwellers, a name I have often suggested in our taxonomic debates.
 That said, at times a Cloud Lord will rise to such splendor that he unites all the cloud citadels and commands scores of cloud dwelling creatures.
 Perched in the highest tower, the beautiful Eagle King is served the choicest bits of food by young male and female servants of all species. Rumors have it that the Eagle King will mate with the most beautiful of his servants regardless of species, be they Man, Kobold or Cloud Dweller. Such is the beauty of the Eagle King that our own diplomat in the cloud city was seduced by the looks of the king, even though his speech was that of a blathering idiot.
 The rule of an Eagle King often ends as abruptly as it started, as the Cloud Dwellers are fickle creatures, just like the clouds around them."

descr "Some of the nobler creatures in, or rather above, Terra Elysiae are the Cloud Dwellers. Just like a swallow is nobler than a badger and the cherry is nobler than the turnip, so are the Cloud Dwellers by nature more noble than humans or most other creatures who live with their feet firmly planted on solid soil.
 Noblest of them all is the Cloud Lord who rules all who live in his realm. The Cloud Lord is strong in magic and talks with both the clouds and the air. Their skin and features are softened by the soft clouds and harsh winds that always surround them, so even the most elderly Cloud Dweller will have skin as soft as a youngling. However, living their lives on soft and cushiony clouds has made a once proud people weak in both mind and soul. The Cloud Lord prefers to lie back in a couch woven of purest air, ignoring any pressing issues plaguing his realm."

newmonster    "Cloud Caster"                                             # 1311
descr "Though powerful magicians, the magic of the cloud casters seems to be a mere memory of an ancient elemental magic. Their mages seem to mainly dwell on confused mutterings and overly complicated ancient rituals. In my attempt to record the magic of Elysium, your very humble author has had the chance to talk with some of their foremost cloud casters. However I was met with strange mutterings, and shown ancient and overly complicated rituals. They did not seem to understand the simplest logic of humoral theory. When trying to explain to them how their magic actually works, I was only met with contempt and misunderstandings. The haughty cloud casters seems to be rooted in their archaic ways, and do not see the progress of modern arcana.
 My suspicions were confirmed when I discussed the matter with the most esteemed Aeolia, wind mage at the Imperial Academy. She has suggested a theory that their magic stems from ancient elemental mages who struck an eternal deal with powerful elemental beings, and their magics are simply a set of rituals aimed at appeasing those elementals."

newmonster    "Storm Captain"                                            # 1312
descr "The Cloud Dwellers’ troops are led by what they call their storm captains. Impervious to searing winds and lightning, storm captains leading their troops are truly a sight to behold. Who cannot be spellbound in seeing the rising sun glisten upon their muscular abdomens and their glorious wings? Alas, the spell is broken as soon as the storm captain chooses to speak. They are all insufferably haughty beings, always keeping their heads in the clouds, and they are rarely coherent. They all seem to suffer from a decadent lifestyle, which has made them weak in both mind and soul. Being able to recline upon clouds daily seems to have weakened their spirit to such a degree that they are only interested in food, sleep and themselves.
 It is said that the storm captains are so dull in mind and lazy that they often perish due to ordering their men to rest upon the froth of ocean waves, believing them to be clouds.
 Quite unlike a duck their feathers will get wet and heavy which will prevent them from flying away from their watery grave."

descr "Their scouts do sometimes travel the lands of man alone, scouting the friend and foe for their lord. They care little about property or matrimony, and are prone to flying away at the first sight of danger or an enraged partner. The rumors of their extramarital adventures has given rise to many novels and stories of a less enlightened kind. Some depraved minds even choose to insert famous individuals as counterparts to the Airya in those stories. It is believed that many of these stories are somehow mass produced by industrious yet depraved Hoburghers.
 No decent person would read such depraved literature, of course. Texts that in detail describes encounters between the emperor, a barmaid and an Airya scout should not be allowed to circulate, regardless of how well and intricately the scout's beautiful wings and body are described, and however funny the scene in the murky tavern is. Not that I would know of any of the content therein.
 No upstanding citizen should read those expensive pamphlets, and the Church of El has rightfully confiscated most such texts that are distributed and sold. It is said that the underground library of the bishop of Balneum et in Cisternis today contains the largest collection of this kind of forbidden literature, and good riddance I say."

 The origins of the Airya or the Cloud Dwellers are subject to speculation.

While the Cloud Dwellers are more noble than the common chicken, there are some similarities between them in their mental capacities."

descr "One may wonder how the Cloud Dwellers' archers are able to keep their bow stable while flying, as their bows do not seem to possess any peculiar properties. When our own soldiers have fired them, the bows seem to be no different from our own. The archers are primarily used for sieges where they will fly over the besieged town or castle and fire their bows from far above. If they were stronger, better organized or had a bit more mental capacity they would make a formidable foe. But being as fickle as the wind has worked against them in many wars.
 Another factor that works against them is their poultry-like intellect. It is said that during the siege of Merburg, an illusionist was hired by the mayor of the town in order to save them from a large host of flying soldiers. The illusionist awaited a heavy rain, and when it started to rain she conjured up a fascinating display in the sky above the Cloud soldiers. They all turned their heads up towards the colorful skies, gaping widely, and and while gaping they failed to notice that their throats filled up with water - so they all drowned while staring up at the sky."

descr "Some of veteran soldiers in the Cloud Lord’s army are given armor that is made from living ice. Shaped like a breastplate with both arm and shin guards, it protects them well, and curiously enough it will not melt even if attacking foes on the ground in the middle of summer.
 This is solid proof that the Cloud Dwellers are cold in their nature and heart. Though some will argue that air is hot and wet by nature, they are in the wrong. As anyone who has experienced a northern wind or the cold rejection of an Airyan scout will know, air has a coldness to it that will chill you to the spine. The Cloud Dwellers are as cold to touch as they are cold in their hearts, and they will emanate a chill that keeps their armor well cooled."

descr "Usually appearing with the breaking sun, the Dawn Guard are a sight to behold, though their gleaming armor that glistens in the sun makes it difficult to look at them for any amount of time. When they aren't busy forming the vanguard of a siege, they do strike one as being the dessert of a great feast. On the outside, a hard, gleaming layer of red caramelized honey, and in the middle, sweet, supple flesh ready for your bite.
 These troops form an elite squad of warriors and their weapons and armour are enhanced with elemental magic."

descr "If the attack at dawn fails, another elite unit in dark armor remains ready to sneak in at night and bring an end to whatever resistance remains. The Dusk Guards have been trained to fly up high and then glide through the air in order to minimize the sound they make. After landing they will sneak through the streets and quickly dispose of the guards on the walls and in other fortified positions. The Dusk Guards are trained from early childhood and are thus not really willing to talk to either any outsiders or other Cloud Dwellers.
 They are even less trustworthy than the regular Cloud Dweller, however, nothing in their behavior during the day suggest that they would be."

descr "It is common knowledge that some of the most prestigious fowl you can serve at a dinner is a royal swan dressed in its own feathers and with a small golden crown on top of its head. Correctly cooked, the meat is succulent, spicy and full of delightful flavors. It is sad that with the current funding from the Imperial administration, our academy has only been able to afford swan banquets for the professors, researchers and administrators on a bimonthly basis.
 What is less known about the swan is that the war on the sky during the reign of Thessalion the Heavy started due to swan being served at an Imperial banquet. In that particular banquet one of the Cloud Lords was invited. Upon seeing a magnificent swan on the table the Cloud Lord withdrew and instantly declared war upon the emperor. Apparently summoned swans are part of the royal guard in the clouds and they are foolishly not considered food among the Cloud Dwellers.
 The empire was of course victorious and ever since swan is being served at the court every Thessalian Tuesday."

newmonster    "Black Hawk"                                               # 1321
descr "These large birds of prey are distant cousins to the hawks used by the nobility of this realm in hunts. Though far too large for regular hunts, some have used the black hawks to hunt for the dreaded deer, and by some courageous few to hunt mountain goats. Their excellent sight have made them the perfect scout for the Cloud Lords.
 Our emperor has tried to emulate this and has ordered a few black hawks to be trained to serve as scouts for our legions. While they can be trained to fly high in the sky and to observe the enemy's camp, it has been next to impossible to gain any useful knowledge from them. Even our best mindreaders cannot get much more information from them than that they have seen some delicious beasts graze the ground beneath them. It has thus been concluded that the Cloud Lords only use their black hawks to intimidate their foes, and the imperial command has issued an order that the hawks should be ignored.
 The meat of the black hawk is dry and tough, so they are not very suitable for roasts even if richly larded."

newmonster    "Solar Eagle"                                              # 1322
descr "Among the Cloud Dwellers there is a widely held belief that once they die, they will be reincarnated as birds. Farmers will be reincarnated as sparrows and pigeons, the common soldiers as black hawks, the idle courtiers as swans. This is of course utter nonsense, but still many Cloud Dwellers will try to identify their grandpa in a nearby flock of pigeons, calling out his name in vain.
 The Solar Eagle is the most noble of all birds and the one that soars the highest, high above even the cloud castles. It is said that they sometimes nest within the distant sun. Some adventurous Airyan scouts have tried to reach the sun in order to find the home of the Solar Eagles, but they have all fallen down with scorched feathers.
 The official policy in many of the cloud castles is that the Cloud Lord will reincarnate as a Solar Eagle, hence why the most prominent of the Cloud Lords call themselves Eagle Kings."

The kobolds, in the act of a simpleton, will fill the caverns of the hatchery with everything that they associate with their patron dragon."

descr "The shaman is often the most prominent of all female kobolds, and runs the everyday affairs in any kobold tribe. She is in charge of organizing the hatchery and gathering gems, colored cloth and other suitable accessories to adorn the hatchery, giving it the right color scheme in order to produce the right sort of kobold. Even though the kobolds do this out of instinct rather than as a planned act, it is believed that this practice originated some time after the kobolds made their pact with the dragons. The shaman is also the one to call for dragons according to their ancient pact.
Kobolds and some scholars of lesser wit believe that the kobolds are related to dragons and that it is this kinship that allows for the kobolds to summon dragons. This is obviously false.
The only things shared between the two species are their vanity, their lust for gold and glittering objects, their color scheme, and some other basic reptilian traits. Because of their belief that they are related, the kobolds bow before and venerate the dragons. And the dragons, in their vanity accept the worship of the kobolds, preferably accompanied by an offering of gleaming gold and a few particularly crunchy kobolds, and in return protect the kobolds as they see fit.
Just like the lamprey clings onto and cleans larger fish, the kobolds enter the dragon’s lair, protect it while it is away, and clean it of dragon guano. It is a well kept secret that dragon guano is used by Hoburgher arborists to fertilize their weed, giving it extra potency."

newmonster    "Blue Kobold Shaman"                                       # 1339
descr "The shaman is often the most prominent of all female kobolds, and runs the everyday affairs in any kobold tribe. She is in charge of organizing the hatchery and gathering gems, colored cloth and other suitable accessories to adorn the hatchery, giving it the right color scheme in order to produce the right sort of kobold. Even though the kobolds do this out of instinct rather than as a planned act, it is believed that this practice originated some time after the kobolds made their pact with the dragons. The shaman is also the one to call for dragons according to their ancient pact.
Kobolds and some scholars of lesser wit believe that the kobolds are related to dragons and that it is this kinship that allows for the kobolds to summon dragons. This is obviously false.
The only things shared between the two species are their vanity, their lust for gold and glittering objects, their color scheme, and some other basic reptilian traits. Because of their belief that they are related, the kobolds bow before and venerate the dragons. And the dragons, in their vanity accept the worship of the kobolds, preferably accompanied by an offering of gleaming gold and a few particularly crunchy kobolds, and in return protect the kobolds as they see fit.
Just like the lamprey clings onto and cleans larger fish, the kobolds enter the dragon’s lair, protect it while it is away, and clean it of dragon guano. It is a well kept secret that dragon guano is used by Hoburgher arborists to fertilize their weed, giving it extra potency."

descr "Kobolds are small, mischievous creatures who like to dig, dig and occasionally dig some more. Unfortunately they are not disciplined enough to dig in the same direction. When not digging, they are quite happily breeding, which makes it easy to mistake them for rabbits. Kobolds claim draconic ancestry, a fact which most scholars would dispute. They do however share some traits with the great dragons. Apart from their reptilian appearance they are fully resistant to the element corresponding to the color of their scales.
The red kobolds, who have been exposed to rubies, lava, crimson cloth or anything else fiery will take on some of the aspects of elemental fire. It may also be that the ruby mines they so prefer are indeed infused with elemental fire and thus some rubs off on the kobolds. So, while craven, the red kobolds are still quick to anger, overeager, and bossy. Though possibly the least of their kind, they always try to boss others around.
 The lowest of all kobolds are the casteless kobolds. They exist only to haul stone, dig, breed, dig some more, clean out the nest and to be devoured first by anything with sharp enough teeth and a good appetite.
The common kobold is quite abundant and they often make up the better, no, larger part of their army. However, they are well known for their cowardice, which sometimes get exacerbated by their large numbers.
In the Kobold Wars in the fall of 1063 Göte the Warlock had amassed  a horde of common kobolds and marched upon the capital. Chronicles say that the horizon was red with kobolds, their army stretching as far as the eye could see.
The war was won without a single battle as one of the minor kobolds got spooked by an apple falling from a tree and started fleeing. His rout spread and soon the whole horde was routing and rampaging through their own lines, leaving a crying Warlock kneeling by the remains of his once proud army."

They do however share some traits with the great dragons. Apart from their reptilian appearance they are fully resistant to the element corresponding to the color of their scales.
Despite a common misconception that the green kobold is associated with growth and nature, their despicable nature and generally slow conduct makes it obvious that they are affiliated with the element of earth. The green color that stems from their scales reflect both the emeralds used in their hatcheries and the green moss growing on the manure piles there. Green kobolds are slow to respond and slow to react. Some attempts at placing various kobolds in cells with a minor horror have revealed that the green kobold will often react at a much slower rate than its brethren. Sometimes it will not react until after it has died. This can easily be mistaken for bravery, which would be a faulty assumption.

descr "Kobolds are small, mischievous creatures who like to dig, dig and occasionally dig some more. Unfortunately they are not disciplined enough to dig in the same direction. When not digging, they are quite happily breeding, which makes it easy to mistake them for rabbits. Kobolds claim draconic ancestry, a fact which most scholars would dispute. They do however share some traits with the great dragons. Apart from their reptilian appearance they are fully resistant to the element corresponding to the color of their scales.
The blue kobolds are associated with water and thus anything cold. They are slippery and untrustworthy, and though we have yet to perform experiments to prove it, a credible theory suggests that they are difficult to mind-control. They will also perform poorly at any given task as both their mind and memory will slip away, just like a goat on ice.
 The lowest of all kobolds are the casteless kobolds. They exist only to haul stone, dig, breed, dig some more, clean out the nest and to be devoured first by anything with sharp enough teeth and a good appetite.

They do however share some traits with the great dragons. Apart from their reptilian appearance they are fully resistant to the element corresponding to the color of their scales.
The white kobold is associated with the air and is thus protected against lightning. The element of air that is being infused into the eggs also makes them a rather unruly bunch. With empty minds, they tend to roam about causing more disorder than any other kobold. Their leaders are obsessed with the idea of flight. A few years ago there were reports of kobolds fitting artificial wings onto their wingless kin.  This went about as well as it would have gone if you put wings on a goat. In order to get light wings, their engineers used parchment. This proved far too tasty for most kobolds, so several of the wings ended up being a late night snack. Some even sampled the wings while trying to fly, with the result one would expect.

descr "The kobolds come in many colors; red, blue, green and white being the most common. Some rare black ones have been sighted and there are rumors of both golden and purple kobolds. How they get their color is unknown, but one possibility is that the kobold will absorb the very materials that surround the egg as it incubates. It is well known that the kobolds fill their hatcheries with one color or another depending on what color they expect their offspring to have. This theory is strengthened by the fact that black kobolds exist. We have yet to obtain any kobold eggs we could expose to other colors. Perhaps we could grow a yellow or even a striped kobold?
The rarest of all observed kobolds are the black ones. They will appear on rare occasions in hatcheries of any color. Among kobolds, the black-scaled ones are both revered and feared, as they do not know from whence they come. Some believe that they stem from eggs that have been burnt. In contrast to many other kobolds they are rather quiet and thus suitable for training in stealthy professions. 
 Why do dragons and kobolds have such diverse colors? Some claim that, just like the salamander, the dragon and the kobold are elemental reptiles and as such their dominant element will also manifest in the color of their scales. This theory hints at there being some kind of truth behind the koboldoid belief that the kobolds are related to dragons. The existence of black kobolds seemingly refutes the theory of an intrinsic elemental connection for kobolds. However, it may just be that they are so full of black bile that their scales take on that color."

newmonster    "Black Kobold Slayer Shaman"                               # 1369
descr "The shaman is often the most prominent of all female kobolds and rules the everyday life in any kobold tribe. She is in charge of organizing the hatchery, gathering gems, colored cloth and other suitable accessories to adorn the hatchery and giving it the right color theme in order to produce the right sort of kobold. Even though kobolds do this out of instinct rather than as a planned act, it is believed that this practice originated sometime after the kobolds made their pact with the Dragons. The Shamans are also the one to call for dragons according to their ancient pact.
It is said that the shamans of the black kobolds skulk around in the shadows of other kobold hatcheries replacing their eggs with their own. In this they resemble the common cuckoo, who throws out the eggs of other birds and then just replaces them with their own. Now the shaman can neither throw them out, nor  carry them with her, so it is assumed that those eggs are eaten.
This likeness to a bird may be a hint to the origin of the kobold. This likeness is further underlined by the uncanny resemblance between a plucked bird and a kobold."

According to what we have discerned from captured kobolds, a shaman will be considered a prophet when she has studied the ancient draconic language in depth and been able to discern the wants and wishes from the elder dragons. Considering the weak mind and puny brain of kobolds, a more probable interpretation is that a kobold prophet is a shaman who is extraordinarily weak in mind and can become a true puppet for those elder dragons.
In the darkest caverns it is said that sometimes a prophet arises among the black kobolds. Being elusive as all of its kind, few if anyone has reported seeing one. But there are tales about a powerful shaman foretelling a time when a large black dragon will swallow the sun and all will live in darkness. This is of course nonsense, just aimed at spreading fear among anyone else. It is likely that what they call a prophet is just nothing more than a glorified assassin."

descr "The boldest of all the kobold troops are the Wyvern Knights, as they ride on fierce wyverns which are prone to eating a kobold or two whenever they are in a bad mood. It is however a mistake to regard them as being particularly courageous, but rather, it is a rather morbid form of stupidity which makes them lack any understanding of what the wyvern might do to them. The knights can still be frightened by large sounds or sudden lights."

newmonster    "Fire Drake"                                               # 1372
descr "The Fire Drake is a large, lizard-like being with a flaming breath.  It might originate from the Elemental planes, but if so, it has since adapted to life in Elysium.  Whatever its origin, the Fire Drake sometimes serves kobolds, Warlocks and other elemental entities."
descr "The first quest for many knights is often to vanquish a fire drake, in order to work their way up to defeating a real dragon. This has the unfortunate consequence that many fire drakes develop a taste for knightly flesh early in their lives, and will, as full grown dragons, seek out towns and castles just so they can fill up their larder with roasted knights."

newmonster    "Storm Drake"                                              # 1373
descr "The young Storm Drake hides in clouds during thunderstorms in order to get close to farms or villages, so that it can capture a goose or two. This seems to be a particular problem in the fall when huge amounts of plump geese and swans are lost to the roaming Storm Drakes.
 Since no one has ever seen an intermediate drake/dragon, there are some speculations that the Storm Drake might gorge itself on birds, small cattle and young humanoids in the fall, and then by winter they pupate in a cloud like material, only to emerge fully grown a few years later. If you ever travel in those parts, beware of trembling clouds as that may very well be a Storm Dragon emerging from its pupal form."

descr "The ingenuity of mankind is unequaled. For centuries we have known how to shape stones into useful blocks. Buildings, small and large, can be made from stone.

Stone walls are very difficult to harm without siege equipment."

newmonster    "Black Dragon Spawn"                                       # 1612
descr "In each batch of eggs one or two will develop some small wings, allowing them to fly. Such a kobold is called a Dragon Spawn and is considered to be holy and only below the king and the shaman in caste. As most kobolds lack the ability to fly, they have some problems teaching their new hatchlings to how to do so.
Their solution is as always very crude and wasteful, in the manner they solve most things. Each year all Dragon Spawn that are considered  mature enough are taken to a special cliff and simply thrown off of it. Those who survive will be part of an elite guard, while those that don’t will become a tasty meal for the rest of the tribe.
Though they have taken the name from the dragons themselves, the Dragon Spawn, in my opinion, are proof that the kobolds are not descended from dragons. Some of our local taxidermists/approved necromancers have received a few dead Dragon Spawn that they have deboned and reconstructed. It should be obvious to anyone examining their skeletons that their wings are not joined to the spine in the same manner as they would be on a dragon. 
Though some critics will claim that the lack of deboned dragons may prove a problem for this claim, it is obvious when looking at any sketch of a dragon.
 The Black Kobolds are amongst the most wicked of their kind and coat their daggers with excrement and worse."

The Garnet Amazons are more ferocious than the other tribes and run some sort of fire cult where being burned is an important thing.  None of the tribes are more than half civilized and they use only weapons that are simple to create and in battle they lack both discipline and tactics.  Their armies consist of only women and actually no males at all have been sighted among them.

descr "When dealing with the almost human-like Vanara, you are prone to think that the monkey peoples are almost civilized, but this impression will soon fade. When you finish your business with the human-sized brutes you will sooner or later encounter groups of chittering Markatas that will follow and harass you until you once more interact with monkeys of higher status. The monkey society is highly stratified with the Markatas at the bottom of society. Their mental faculties are barely more advanced than that of rabbits or pigeons and in my opinion it is only due to their racial similarities to the Vanara that they are considered part of the monkey people. The monkey people claim that your deeds in life will grant you a new life in another body upon death, and the Markatas are those punished for a sinful former life. If true, the sheer number of Markatas clearly demonstrates the degenerate behavior of all monkeys."

newmonster    "Markata Archer"                                           # 1644
descr "The Markatas are simple minded beasts only slightly more clever than the average dog. Strangely enough, they are still considered part of society and are sometimes gathered and trained to follow command. They are not clever enough to understand warfare and can easily be driven towards the enemy unaware of the danger of enemy archers. Sometimes they are given small bows, but the reason behind this is probably mostly to encourage the brutes to join the army, as the bows are much too weak to be useful in combat."

descr "According to the lore of the White Ones there are akashic realms beyond ours that are inhabited by beings blessed with divine splendor. Vanara society mimics the hierarchies of the akashic realms. Just like the Vanara serve their Bandar Kings the Nagas of Patala follow their Naga Kings. But where the Bandar Kings resort to brute force and oppression to rule their subjects, the otherwise sly Nagas follow their kings out of respect for those endowed with ancient wisdom. Thus all Naga kings are both wise and skilled in magic. In a people of wicked serpents one would not expect to find such righteousness, but the Naga Kings are truly august. If only the kings of men would display such rectitude."

Fortunately we have rid most of our lands from sin, so the eventual destruction of the world by a cosmic dancer lies hundreds, perhaps even thousands of years in the future. Only if we fail to protect our lands from the monkey people and their despicable ways should the destruction of the world become a matter of worry, and if that happens the world might as well end anyways."

descr "While most monkeys of the Rakshasa Kingdom have abandoned the wisdom of the White Ones for the false truths of the Rakshasas, there are some who have taken their own path to find the truth. Mimicking the asceticism of the White Ones, some female Bandar have abandoned civilization to live with the atavi tribes in search of ancient truths not found under the yoke of the Rakshasa Kings. Little do they understand that Maya takes many forms, and atavism is just another route to depravity and the downfall of your soul."

descr "While most Kala-Mukhas are the result of a Rakshasa impregnating a Bandar female, there are reports of Kala-Mukhas with far greater status than the Kala-Mukha Warriors. Similar in appearance, but superior in mind and even more depraved, these Kala-Mukhas are most likely the result of a Bandar male mating with a Rakshasi sorceress. That this can happen only further demonstrates the depravity of the monkey-people. These rare Kala-Mukhas serve the Rakshasa Kings as sorcerer-priests, preparing sacrifices and blood-feasts for their masters. Beware, should you encounter one, lest you might end up as the main course at a Rakshasa's dinner table."

descr "Thanks to the sublime ingenuity of the White Ones the armies of the Monkey Maharaja have acquired the means to craft armors of almost human quality. This however, is not the case in the depraved kingdom ruled by the Rakshasa Kings. Instead, if you venture into these cursed lands you might encounter black-skinned Bandars of great stature, but with less sophisticated armors. Know then, that these brutes are not what they seem, for they are demons. The Kala-Mukha are demonic half-breeds born from the unholy coupling of a female Bandar and a Rakshasa. The Kala-Mukhas are depraved monstrosities in Bandar form, and seem to be the only monkeys the Rakshasa Kings really trusts."

Since the possessed corpses are supposed to have will and mind, giving them armor should be less time consuming than equipping regular walking corpses with armor, but the monkey manufacturies are probably not efficient enough to take advantage of this fact."

newmonster    "Failed Reincarnation"                                     # 1728
descr "According to those who have taken it upon themselves to study the dead and the afterlife, after death has claimed a body the spirit will remain. This dispossessed spirit will travel to the Underworld to relive its life for eternity. Sometimes the spirit gets lost or is otherwise unable to enter the Underworld. Unexpectedly, the monkey-people seem to have spirits as well, albeit of lesser sophistication then humans of course. In the monkey society, where belief in reincarnation is prevalent, such an apparition is not a spirit that has lost its way on the journey to the Underworld, but rather a spirit who has been unable to reincarnate properly, be it because of improper burial rituals or something more sinister. Of the few observed cases of Failed Reincarnations, it has not been possible to in any meaningful way distinguish Failed Reincarnations from Dispossessed spirits. Apart from the obvious fact that the Failed Reincarnations appear as transparent monkeys."

descr "Soulless is the general term for a corpse that walks on its own accord. While most reports of these abominations refer to human corpses, it is quite likely that a necromancer could reanimate dead monkey-people without having to alter his rituals to any great extent. It is a well known fact that the soul of a deceased man suffers greatly if his corpse is molested by necromantic magic. Since the monkey-people barely possess souls in the first place we should encourage necromancers to move to southern lands where they could ply their trade without risking the suffering of human souls. Succendemus the Fair still claims that a crusade against the necromancers of this world is preferable to negotiations, especially when the other part is supposedly immortal."

descr "While most mages are intelligent and rational, those who practice the dark arts often succumb to mood-swings and madness. It is therefore understandable that they act irrationally. While reanimating the dead might give a necromancer obedient servants, it is obvious to anyone that reanimated monkeys are useless even if they are obedient. Supposedly they can climb up to repair the inner ceiling of their master's citadel, but being mindless and more or less unable to use tools they would not accomplish anything. In battle they would be even less useful, as other stronger soulless would step and stumble on the disgusting corpse-monkeys."

descr "During the exhibition at Grafswald Castle count Wulfhere brought three specimens from the southern lands. Two were of human size, but the third skeleton was that of a huge ape never before seen in the realm. Unfortunately the bones became restless, probably due to being brought so far from its home lands. The skeletal ape attacked and slew the countess of Grafswald and two of her maidens before being destroyed. Slanderous tongues have suggested that the skeleton should not have moved on its own and was actually reanimated by count Wulfhere himself, in an attempt to rid himself of the countess and seize her lands."
